  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We wish to clarify the process
  by which we place our material into the public domain so that
  others can use it. As part of that process, we place the material
  shown below at the bottom of every webpage and document (eg.
  pdf) after two blank lines, and under the title About This Page.
  using Ellis S. Nolley as an example person and 17 April 2004
  as an example date. For simplicity, we place it on every document,
  regardless of regardless of whether it contains an invention.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The first and last sentences
  are separated from the middle four sentences by a line break.
  At the first usage of the person's name in the first line, we
  link their name to their address and 'Phoenix' and the first
  few words of the page title separated by the 'underscore' character,
  so that the author can identify from where an email came, as
  in the following example: mailto:e.nolley@ieee.org?subject=Phoenix_how_to_label
  . Optionally, after this material, you may place the centered
  line 'Back to the Phoenix Home Page' and link it to the home
  page.</FONT></P>
