  <p>The purpose of the Sphygmochron.org website project is to
construct a website that would make Sphygmochron software for analyzing
blood pressures and heart rates time-structurally [1]&nbsp; and other
information available to the public and to advanced transdisciplinary
basic as well as biomedicalresearch, with the latter gradually improving the service rendered by the website to self-care recipients. </p>



  
  
  
  <p>This is currently just a proposal of project work that the Phoenix
Project might do, or at least support. &nbsp;It has not been reviewed
or approved by members of the Phoenix Project, and no commitment to any
ideas presented on this page is implied.</p>



  
  
  
  <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId449436"></a>Project Deliverables</h3>



  
  
  
  <h3>Introduction</h3>



This paper describes a possible vision for a web site that makes
Sphygmochron software and other information available to the general
public.
  
  
  
  <h3>Rationale</h3>



The intent of the web site is to provide cost-free access to
Sphygmochron analysis software for home users of blood pressure
monitors, and their professional healthcare providers.
&nbsp;Sphygmochron software provides multiple&nbsp;analyses of a series
of blood pressure measurements made with commercially-available blood
pressure monitors intended for home use, and with high-quality monitors
normally found only in health care settings.<br>
  <br>
Sphygmochron software provides multiple analyses of a series of blood
pressure and heart rate measurements made with commercially-available
blood pressure monitors intended for manual home use, and with
"ambulatory" (ambulatorily usable) monitors available with an 80%
discount through a BIOCOS project (corne001@umn.edu) directly to
individuals or as used in conventional health care settings for
complementary chronomic analyses.<br>



  <br>
Analyses are primarily oriented towards diagnoses of multiple types of
blood pressure and heart rate variability disorders. Some of these
diagnoses are more precise than those that can commonly be done with
single blood pressure measurements taken in clinical settings, or even
with 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring that is now
occasionally done by health care professionals when it is not
interpreted chronomically. There is value in:<br>



  
  
  
  <ul>



    <li>detecting and treating conditions earlier than is done now by healthcare workers</li>



    <li>tuning treatment not according to generally specified
times of day or week (mistakenly thought to be applicable to most
individuals) but based on prior information in the given person's
record before treatment and with the treatment validated in a follow-up
record</li>
    <li>relating changes in blood pressure and heart rate to emotional and physical activity and tuning treatment accordingly</li>
    <li>preventing unnecessary treatment when hypertension is incorrectly diagnosed, such as the so-called "white coat hypertension" [1]</li>
    <li>instituting treatment in so-called "masked hypertension" [1]</li>
    <li>detecting variability disorders of blood pressure or heart
rate, including those that occur within the range of usual values such
as:<br>
1. an overswing of systolic or diastolic blood pressure, measured as a
circadian blood pressure amplitude (extent of change, A) exceeding
reference limits derived from peers of the same<br>
age and gender;<br>
2. an odd timing of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure in the face of an acceptable timing of heart rate<br>
3. an above-threshold pulse pressure; and<br>
4. a below-threshold standard deviation of heart rate; and<br>
5-n any other possibly undesirable conditions such as changes in a
circadian or infradian period of blood pressure or heart rate, e.g.,
desynchronizations or variance transpositions, or changes in amplitude
ratios, the clinical importance of which is still a topic of research.</li>



  
  
  
  </ul>
Disorders in variability of heart rate and blood pressure may, in some
cases, represent health risks equal to or greater than those associated
with a diagnosis of hypertension. [For example, see appendix <a href="SAViNGLiVES.pdf">Saving Lives</a>, available as a handout from the <a href="http://www.msi.umn.edu/%7Ehalberg/">Halberg Chronobiology Center</a> at the University of Minnesota.]&nbsp;<br>



  <br>



A major aim of the website is to enable a "self-helped" style of
medical care; it is our belief that the current trend towards more
self-directed health care will continue, and this website should
provide resources for use in such self-directed health care as its
primary function. &nbsp;The website is also available for healthcare
professionals to use directly in analyses of patients not participating
in the self-helped style of medical care.<br>



  <br>



The web site contents and usage of the analysis software is made free
to all, in exchange for permission to use all blood pressure data and
associated medical history that is entered into the web site for
analysis in medical research projects (specifically the BIOCOS project)
and to improve the database of reference values that the software draws
upon to interpret the results of the analysis and hence with yearly information by the user via e-mail of his/her health status.<br>



  
  
  
  <h3>Usage of the sphygmochron software</h3>
[TBD: Consult <a href="yhow030725.doc">"Why and How"</a>,&nbsp;available as a handout from the <a href="http://www.msi.umn.edu/%7Ehalberg/">Halberg Chronobiology Center</a> at the University of Minnesota]
  
  
  
  <h3>Contents of the web site</h3>



The website will grow and evolve over time. &nbsp;Specific components
are to be implemented, to guide its growth. &nbsp;The first component
is intended to appeal to the self-helped care individual user.
&nbsp;The components that follow make the web site more useful to both
the individual user, health care professionals, and researchers in the
field. &nbsp;These additional components are expected to be implemented
in an overlapping way rather than sequentially, beginning after the
first component is complete.<br>



  
  
  
  <h4>Component 1: Single home user</h4>



In this stage, the web site consists of an introductory "splash" screen with the web site name and links to the following items:<br>



  
  
  
  <ul>



    <li>A user manual for the Sphygmochron software</li>



    <li>A "create account" page</li>



    <li>A login page</li>



    <li>A page to upload blood pressure data to be analyzed</li>



  
  
  
  </ul>



The scenario here is to allow a single home user to log in and submit
his own blood pressure data for analysis, regardless of whether that
data was collected by an automated ambulatory blood pressure monitor,
or was collected some other way. &nbsp;<br>



  <br>



The user creates an account with a name and password of his own choosing.
&nbsp;He is encouraged, but not required, to associate an email address
with this account. &nbsp;He is automatically assigned a patient id that
is to be used in lieu of his name.<br>



  <br>



The upload page asks for the blood pressure data in a specific-format
Excel file (the .pr0 format), gender, age, sleep and wake times,
previously-diagnosed diseases, and prescription and non-prescription
medication being taken. &nbsp;It returns the Sphygmochron analysis
document in a form that the user can save on his computer or print on
paper.<br>



  <br>



The information collected is saved for the BIOCOS project. &nbsp;It is
moved off from the website computer to help make that computer less of
a target for internet hackers.<br>



  <br>



  
  
  
  <h4>Component 2: Multiple input formats</h4>



Blood pressure data in formats other than the .pr0 Excel format would be accepted by the website.<br>



  <br>



To support a scenario of a home user with a blood pressure monitor
without a way to download the data to a computer file, the website will
allow the user to type the blood pressure measurements in to a web page
directly. &nbsp;The measurements will be returned to the user in both
the Sphygmochron report and in a datafile or Excel spreadsheet that the
user can save on his computer.<br>



  <br>



To support users retrieving data directly from blood pressure monitors,
the website will accept files as produced by the device directly.
&nbsp;This may mean decoding or decompressing files; we will be
dependent on manufacturers of the devices to give us information on
proprietary file formats. &nbsp;(And that kind of information may not
be easily obtainable.)<br>



  <br>



To support home users and health care practitioners that have purchased
other blood pressure analysis software such as Dr. Pro, the website
will accept data files used by or produced by such software. &nbsp;This
may again be dependent on our ability to obtain information about
proprietary file formats.
  
  
  
  <h4>Component 3: Multiple patients per account</h4>



The purpose here is to expand the "account" concept so a logged-in user
can perform analyses for multiple people. &nbsp;The first major
scenario to be supported include a family member doing the web site
access for children, aged parents, people with disabilities, or others
that fall within his guardianship. &nbsp;The second scenario is for a
healthcare professional to log in and submit data for patients.<br>



  <br>



The web site account concept will be extended to allow the logged in
user to create multiple patient IDs. &nbsp;Any logged in user that has
multiple patient IDs associated with it must specify the patient ID
when running a Sphygmochron analysis.<br>



  
  
  
  <h4>Component 4: Comparative Analyses</h4>



In this stage, comparative analysis programs currently used at the
Halberg Chronobiology Center can be run by a logged in user. &nbsp;The
comparative analysis programs need two or more files of blood pressure
data taken at different times in the patient's life. &nbsp;<br>



  <br>
The scenario here is to allow the patient or his health care
professional to look for long-term trends. &nbsp;[TBD: What do the
comparative analysis programs really produce that's of value to the
patient or his doctor?]<br>



  <br>



Implementation of this stage could take either of two directions.
&nbsp;The first is to require the user to upload old blood pressure
data files as well as current ones for the analysis; this allows us to
maintain the philosophy that the website does not keep copies of users' data on the system where they may
become accidentally available to website hackers. &nbsp;The second is
to implement higher levels of website security sufficient to make us
and the users comfortable with keeping all historical data available to
the website computer.<br>



  <br>


If the second direction (keeping historical data available to the
website machine) is chosen, a feature of the website can be to display
all data and analyses for a particular patient, to support a scenario
where a patient that has been self-monitoring for some time decides to
involve a health care professional and make the historical data
available to that professional for analysis.<br>



  
  
  
  <h4>Component 5: The Library</h4>



A small, well-focused library of materials related to Sphygmochron
analysis, heart and blood vessel physiology, cardiac diseases, and
treatments will be kept on the web site. &nbsp;It is important for it
not to become a disorganized collection of seemingly random links to
information scattered around the web.<br>



  <br>



The Library will contain sections for different types of users:<br>



  
  
  
  <ul>



    <li>Children ("Daddy, what's that <span style="font-style: italic;">thing</span> on your arm?" type questions)</li>



    <li>High school and college students</li>



    <li>Adult home users</li>



    <li>Medical and health care students and professionals</li>



  
  
  
  </ul>



The most important section might be the one for adult home users. &nbsp;It needs to support an ability to:
  
  
  
  <ul>



    <li>learn intermediate and advanced analysis of Sphygmochrons</li>



    <li>research medical conditions, diseases, and treatments beyond the level of everyday "household" words</li>



  
  
  
  </ul>



&nbsp;by users with different backgrounds and levels of education.<br>



  <br>



The Library will contain materials that are not yet accepted by many
mainstream medical professionals. &nbsp;To prevent the Library from being perceived as having been produced by a "crackpot", the
materials that are made available will have to be professional,
presentable, and not refer to unsubstantiated theory. &nbsp;The
materials must be of sufficient quality that a mainstream medical
professional <span style="font-style: italic;">would</span> accept them given sufficient exposure and education.<br>
  <h4>Component 6: The "forum" (bulletin board)<br>



  </h4>



A popular web mechanism used by some moderately intense internet home
users in self-help or self-directed education situations
is&nbsp;"forum" software that lets users communicate with each other
via leaving publicly available messages directly on the web site.<br>



  <br>



Multiple forums can be made available, to organize entries into
categories such as How to use the Software, and self-organized support
groups. &nbsp;(Within each category, multiple conversations are carried
on simultaneously with the concept of forum "threads".)<br>



  <br>



A "chat room" service could also be made available. &nbsp;The
effectiveness of this seems questionable. &nbsp;Even if we could
provide a medical professional to guide interactive chats in useful
directions, this doesn't seem likely to be worth the effort. &nbsp;I
think this would be similar to radio programs that put a medical
profession on the air to answer questions that people are not
comfortable asking their doctor; my experience is that the medical
professional can not effectively help those who ask the questions
(often for legal reasons), and end up repeating a phrase such as "you
should consult with your personal physician on this subject" over and
over.<br>



  <br>



The website is not to provide a "blog" (web log) capability that would
allow a user to own an entire page in an attempt to publish to the
world some fringe opinion or other agenda.<br>



  
  
  
  <h4>Component 7: The help desk</h4>



At least one email address would be published on the website for the
purpose of having a place for users to go to when they have problems or
questions. &nbsp;Instructions on the website would promise
confidentiality. &nbsp;Multiple addresses may be useful for different
categories of problems, such as mechanical problems with the website or
Sphygmochron software, submitting documents for inclusion in the
library, and requesting a professional opinion of a particular
Sphygmochron analysis.<br>
  <br>
A "live" help desk, staffed by humans, is not currently envisioned.
  
  
  
  <h3>User Account concepts</h3>
[TBD]


  
  
  
  <h3>Security and Privacy notes</h3>



[TBD. &nbsp;Includes HIPAA. &nbsp;Consent form prior to uploading data files to the Sphygmochron]
  
  
  
  <h3>Website funding and hosting</h3>



Development of the software and Library is done by volunteer labor.
&nbsp;However, hosting the website includes purchasing computers and/or
commercial web hosting services, purchasing software, administration
and troubleshooting, and responding to contacts from users. &nbsp;These
things generally cost money.<br>



  <br>



Potential sources of funding beyond what can be done by volunteer labor include:<br>



  
  
  
  <ul>



    <li>government grants such as those from the NIH</li>



    <li>private philanthropic organizations such as the Gates Foundation</li>



    <li>University resources such as office space and internet access</li>



  
  
  
  </ul>



  <br>



  
  
  
  <h3>"Advertising"</h3>
In this section's title, the word "advertising" refers to advertising
the existence of the website to the potential user base, and
encouraging them to visit it on an ongoing basis.<br>
  <br>
Getting users to visit and use the website is a major issue.
&nbsp;Potential users will have no idea the service exists, so it will
not occur to them to search for it; entries in web search engines will
not draw users to the site. &nbsp;Other ideas include:<br>



  
  
  
  <h4>Published material</h4>



In addition to making the site known, there is a need to educate the
public about the need for blood pressure analysis and self-directed
health care. &nbsp;Popular, affordable, effective ways of educating the
general public on new concepts include publishing books and magazine
articles. &nbsp;Books can be very thorough, and can be more comfortable
to read for a large segment of the general poplation. &nbsp;However,
they are expensive to write and publish.<br>



  <br>



Magazine articles may be easier to write, and can be targeted towards
the readership of a particular magazine or market segment. &nbsp;For
example, a sports magazine may accept an article that explains how to
use Sphygmochron analysis in a sports-medicine context. &nbsp;A
financial magazine may accept an article that explains use the
Sphygmochron in diagnosing hypertension in older male executives with
sedentary occupations.&nbsp; A golf magazine may accept an article that
contains an overview that combines those two areas. &nbsp;A magazine
for housewives may accept an article with stories, annecdotes, and
testimonials about the ability to detect cardiac diseases in women that
are typically overshadowed by media coverage of health problems of men.<br>



  <br>



Although they may be easier to write, magazine articles may be hard to
sell. &nbsp;In addition, they are not likely to provide a steady stream
of new users to the website.<br>



  
  
  
  <h4>Pay-per-click advertising</h4>



The website might display advertising about medical products and
services to generate some income. &nbsp;Almost any advertising,
however, would probably work against the desire to maintain a certain
perceived level of professionalism, quality, and independence from
financial motivation.<br>



  
  
  
  <h4>Email communications</h4>



For those accounts where the user was willing to provide an email
address, a notification service could send emails reminding the user to
provide new data for analysis on a regular or semi-regular schedule, to
update his medical history once a year, or inform the user of new
services being made available. &nbsp;More difficult to implement would
be an ability to "subscribe" to notifications of new threads in the
forum or materials in the Library that match that user's interests.
&nbsp;All such email generated from the website should be designed to
help draw the user back to the website from time to time.<br>
