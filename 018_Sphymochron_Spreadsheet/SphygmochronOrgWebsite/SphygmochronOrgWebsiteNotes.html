This page contains a few reminders of things I need to remember to think more about

  <p class="MsoPlainText">[Note that we don't ask anything about how the data was collected.<span style="">&nbsp;
  </span>I presume that we should ask things like what model of monitor was used...]<br>

  <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">My
words currently allow for anonymous users. &nbsp;Franz has me convinced
that that is a bad idea, now that I'm starting to understand the
importance of the followups. &nbsp;If anonymous users are allowed,
nearly every user will be anonymous, and that leads to no followups.<br>
  </span>
  <p class="MsoPlainText">[I need a different&nbsp;word for "patient" .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the home user case, he&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">doesn't think of himself as a patient.].</span></p>

  <p class="MsoPlainText">The scenario here is to allow the patient or his&nbsp;health care professional to look for long-term&nbsp;trends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[Why?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>what do the comparative analysis &nbsp;programs really produce that's of value to the &nbsp;patient or his doctor?<span style="">&nbsp;

explain what we're doing to my&nbsp;reasonably educated friends, they are all very&nbsp;interested until I mention anything to do with &nbsp;blood pressure and sunspots or solar wind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At &nbsp;that point, they ask me what kind of nutcase I'm involved with.<span style="">&nbsp;
  </span>It's harmless and all in fun when &nbsp;it's just my friends, but any hint of that kind &nbsp;of response from users on the website would be &nbsp;fatal to the reputation of the website.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm just &nbsp;trying to figure out how to guard against that.]<o:p></o:p></p>
