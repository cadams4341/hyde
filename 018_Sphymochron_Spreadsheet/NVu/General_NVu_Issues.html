Some general issues with NVu<br>


<br>


Problems:<br>


It does not handle HTML file names (or any othe r file name) with
spaces in the name correctly. &nbsp;This is mostly an FTP issue,
actually. &nbsp;However, NVu not only allows to create files with names
that won't work right, it actually encourages it by giving your new
HTML files a name derived from the page title that you enter when you
save the file for the first time. &nbsp;If you type in a title with
spaces in it that's pleasant for humans to read, the resulting default
file name will cause problems later.<br>
