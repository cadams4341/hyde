  <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId244142"></a>Project Description</h3>









  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>The purpose of this page is to record some efforts to "fix" the problem with the &lt;model&gt; ABPM cuff that I used. &nbsp;</p>


  
  
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><cite>I'm trying to solve a small
problem with the blood pressure monitor I wore.&nbsp; The cuff is
cloth, and pulls through a stainless-steel D-ring, wraps back upon
itself, and attaches to itself with Velcro.&nbsp; After I&nbsp;wear it
for a few hours and it has inflated and deflated a few times, the cloth
that is pulled through the D-ring slides up or down to one end or the
other of the D-ring.<br>


  <br>


Germaine showed me an older cuff from a different (now out-of-business)
company that's similar, but it has a rubber roller on the D-ring.&nbsp;
That prevents the cloth cuff from sliding up or down the ring and
bunching up at the end.&nbsp; I can't get a rubber roller onto the
D-rings of the cuffs the University currently has (at least, not very
easily or cheaply), but I could imagine a spray-on rubber coating such
as the rubberized undercoating used on cars that would be almost as
good, and only a few dollars...</cite></p>


  
  
  <p>With that thought, which occurred shortly after my first two-week
trial of the ABPM, I set out to try a few things and report on the
results...</p>









  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId449436"></a>Project Deliverables</h3>









  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <ul id="mozToc">









<!--mozToc h3 1-->
  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>


I pried the handles off from a few kitchen measuring cups; the handles
were stainless-steel and similar in size and shape to the D-ring on the
ABPM cuff. &nbsp;I asked a few people for ideas of things to try:<br>


  
  
  <ul>


    <li>Double-sided tape</li>


    <li>Cloth tape</li>


    <li>Hockey tape</li>


    <li>Filing or knurling the stainless-steel surface until rough</li>


    <li>Spray-on automobile undercoating</li>


    <li>Spray-on recreational vehicle roof repair</li>


    <li>Rubber membrane building roofing</li>
    <li>Soft flexible C-flex (C-06424  Cole Parmer), gum rubber&nbsp;(C-95238), or norprene&nbsp;(C-95710) split tubing glued onto rigid split polycarbonate&nbsp;(C-95911) or polypropylene (C-06500) tubing</li>


    <li>Combinations of the above, such as knurling or taping the
stainless-steel before spraying a coating on it (to make the coating,
which wasn't designed to stick on medical-grade stainless-steel, bond
better).</li>


  
  
  </ul>


  <br>


The things I have tried so far include:<br>


  
  
  <ul>


    <li>Johnson &amp; Johnson "Tough-Strips" waterproof Band-Aid.</li>


    <li>3M "Nexcare Products" First Aid Absolute Waterproof Tape (rubberized surface, though not advertised that way)</li>


    <li>3M "Nexcare Products" Athletic Cloth Tape</li>


    <li>3M Scotch "Indoor Gripping Tape for Rugs"</li>


    <li>Autobody Master Rubberized Undercoat (non-paintable)</li>

    <li>Unidentified rubber tubing from my garage</li>


  
  
  </ul>


The band-aid and waterproof tape both wrapped onto the stainless steel
easily and provided a reasonable rubberized surface. &nbsp;They are
both thin, yet tough enough I think they'll last for a while with the
cuff rubbing on them. &nbsp;I chose the particular style of band-aid
("tough-strips") because other band-aids have smoother surfaces and are
not likely to work as well.<br>


  <br>


The Athletic tape was slightly disappointing. &nbsp;The cloth tape I
remember from childhood had a rougher surface. &nbsp;However, it
wrapped onto the stainless-steel very well, and is thin and tough.
&nbsp;I think it would reasonably well, but not quite as well as the
band-aid.<br>


  <br>


The "Gripping Tape for Rugs" didn't work at all. &nbsp;It is a bit too
thick to wrap around the small stainless-steel rod. &nbsp;When I used
one thickness of it, it didn't stick to the rod. &nbsp;Using a wider
piece, so it wrapped all the way around and onto itself, didn't help;
the tape doesn't stick well enough to stay in place for more than a few
seconds, and certainly wouldn't hold with the cloth cuff rubbing on it.<br>


  <br>


I have not yet tried double-sided tape, hockey tape, or roofing materials.<br>


  <br>


  
  
  <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>


I do not yet have any experience with how well the materials hold up over time with the cloth cuff rubbing on them.<br>


  <br>


The band-aid and the waterproof tape, both available in any pharmacy
and in most any household with kids or grandkids, are cheap, easily
available, easy to put on, and provide a tacky enough surface that I
think they'll solve the problem when I try them on a real ABPM cuff.
&nbsp;There is no concern with toxic materials coming on contact with
the skin of the ABPM wearer.<br>





  <br>


The automobile undercoating may contain toxic materials. &nbsp;It was
messy to put on, as the nozzle on the spray can was designed to cover
large flat areas under a car, not a short narrow rod<br>
