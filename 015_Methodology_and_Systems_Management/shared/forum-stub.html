		<h3>What is a Forum?</h3>
		<p>
			A forum is an online discussion group.
			Online services and bulletin board services (BBS's) provide a
			variety of forums, in which participants with common interests can
			exchange open messages.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Newsgroups versus Conferences</h3>
		<p>
			Forums are sometimes called <em>newsgroups</em> or <em>conferences</em>.
			The terms are only partly synonymous.
			Newsgroups support asynchronous communication; conferences are a
			feature of instant messaging. The latter is not a good option
			for system development forums, for three reasons:
			<ul>
				<li>
					System development forums must support discussions that
					span days, weeks, or months.
				</li>
				<li>
					An instant messaging conference is like a meeting; getting
					the timezone-dispersed members of an open-source project
					online at once can be difficult.
				</li>
				<li>
					Finally, system development projects need persistent records
					of their discussions.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Forum Organization</h3>
		<p>
			Forums are most useful when they are organized into topical
			categories. The index provides focus for both writers and readers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The forum index from the
			<a href="http://metaverse.sourceforce.net" target="_blank">Open Source Metaverse Project</a>
			is offered here as a reasonable start for a discussion about the
			Phoenix Project forum index.
		</p>

		<h3>Moderated or Unmoderated?</h3>
		<p>
			Newsgroups are sometimes monitored by an individual or a group
			(the moderator) who has the authority to block messages deemed
			inappropriate.
			Moderated newsgroups have fewer flames and less spam than
			unmoderated forums.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of course, moderating a forum takes somebody's time, time that could
			be spent on some other part of the project.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Technology</h3>
		<p>
			The old internet newsgroups are pretty much pass&eacute;.
			Popular alternatives are:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>mailing lists</strong> &#151;
					This is effectively what is currently used by the Phoenix
					Project. It suffers from the lack of persistence and
					organization.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Wiki</strong> &#151;
					Forums can be placed within a Wiki, which could also
					serve for shared document content management.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>bulletin board service</strong> &#151;
					The Metaverse Project uses
					<a href="http://www.phpbb.com" target="_blank">phpBB</a>,
					a free, open-source, bulletin board package.
					The Phoenix Project could host phpBB, or a competing
					package, on the project's web site.
				</li>
			</ul>
