		<h3>What is a Software Forge?</h3>
		<p>
			A software forge is a centralized place for developers to control
			and manage software development.
		</p>
		<p>
			The core element of any software forge is a repository for files
			managed with a version control tool.
			Many projects limit the function of their forge to version control;
			the term <em>forge</em> would be meaningless to those projects. 
		</p>
		<p>
			A fullfledged collaborative development environment typically
			provides more than version control:
			<ul>
				<li>a home page</li>
				<li>pages for:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>release management</li>
					<li>software download packages</li>
					<li>defect and issue tracking</li>
					<li>documents</li>
					<li><a href="forum-stub.html">forums</a></li>
					<li>support</li>
				</ul>
				<li>defect and issue tracking</li>
				<li>site administration</li>
			</ul>
			Any project needs these capabilities regardless of the degree of
			integration.
		</p>
		<p>
			Software forges are not inherently restricted to software.
			Any activity generating work products in the form of computer files
			(such as, CAD/CAM drawings) could manage those files with the tools
			of a software forge.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Forge Technology</h3>
		<p>
			The team is currently experimenting with various version control tools:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.cvshome.org" target="_blank">CVS &#151; the Concurrent Versions System</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org" target="_blank">Subversion</a>, intended as a replacement for CVS</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Employing a collaborative development environment can dictate a
			particular version control tool.
			Such environments include:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">SourceForge</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://gforge.org/" target="_blank">GForge</a></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Cost is an issue when considering collaborative development
			environments.
