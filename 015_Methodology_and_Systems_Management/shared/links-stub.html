		<h3>Guidelines for/thoughts about this page</h3>
		<h4>What links do we provide?</h4>
		<p>
			This page should link to any external resource that is useful to
			the general Phoenix community.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="http://www.opencroquet.org" target="_blank">
			<img alt="Open Croquet Project" src="http://www.opencroquet.org/Images/head_index.jpg" width="160" height="30" align="left"></a>
			See the
			<a href="http://www.opencroquet.org/links.html" target="_blank">Croquet Project</a>
			for an example of a links page with blog references.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What is a Blog?</h4>
		<p>
			From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">Wikipedia</a>:
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					A <em>weblog</em>, <em>web log</em> or simply a <em>blog</em>,
					is a web application that contains periodic posts on a
					common webpage.
					These posts are often but not necessarily in reverse
					chronological order.
					Such a website is typically accessible to any Internet
					user&#133;
				</p>
				<p>
					Blogs run from individual diaries to arms of political
					campaigns, media programs and corporations, and from one
					occasional author to having large communities of writers.
					Some are maintained by single authors, while others have
					multiple authors.
					Many weblogs enable visitors to leave public comments, which
					can lead to a community of readers centered around the blog;
					others are non-interactive.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
		</p>
		
		<h4>What are Phoenix Project Blogs?</h4>
		<p>
			Phoenix Project blogs are simply a means for interested people to
			write about the Phoenix Project. They allow communication that is
			less formal than typical project communications like the
			<a href="forum-stub.html">forums</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Grouping blogs with links implies the following:
			<ul>
				<li>
					The authors are members of the Phoenix community and use
					their blogs to write about topics relevant to the community.
				</li>
				<li>
					The authors control the content, tools. formats, and hosting
					of their blogs.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			
		</p>
		
		<h4>Blog Technology</h4>
		<p>
			This is only an issue if blogs are brought into the Phoenix web site,
			rather than being handled as external resources.
		</p>
		<p>
			A blog can be built with a variety of tools.  It is sometimes
			incorporated into a collaborative development environment (like
			<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">SourceForge</a>)
			or a wiki (see <a href="wiki-stub.html">Phoenix Wiki</a>), though
			often with the entire community able to make entries.
		</p>
		<p>
			An interesting blogging tool is <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a>.
