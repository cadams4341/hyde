			<h3>What is a Wiki?</h3>
			<p>
				From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						A Wiki or wiki (pronounced "wicky", "weekee", or "veekee")
						is a website (or other hypertext document collection) that
						allows users to add content, as on an Internet forum, but
						also allows anyone to edit the content.
						"Wiki" also refers to the collaborative software used to
						create such a website&#133;
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Key characteristics&#133;</strong>
						A wiki enables documents to be written collectively in a
						simple markup language using a web browser.
						A single page in a wiki is referred to as a "wiki page,"
						while the entire body of pages, which are usually highly
						interconnected via hyperlinks, is called "the wiki."
					<p>
						A defining characteristic of wiki technology is the ease
						with which pages can be created and updated.
						Generally, there is no review before modifications are
						accepted, and most wikis are open to the general public &#151;
						or at least anyone who has access to the wiki server.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
			</p>
			<p>
				The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
				itself is an example of a wiki.
			</p>
			<p>
				Wikis are sometimes regarded as web content management systems.
			</p>
			
			<h3>What is the Phoenix Project Wiki?</h3>
			<p>
				The Phoenix Project Wiki is envisioned for collaborative writing of
				the documents produced by the project team.
			</p>
			<p>
				The wiki may serve purposes other than document management.
				For example, the
				<a href="forum-stub.html">Phoenix Project Forums</a>
				might be hosted on the wiki as well.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Wiki Technology</h3>
			<p>
				This is a work in progress.
				The team is currently experimenting with
				<a href="http://www.jot.com" target="_blank">JotSpot</a>.
