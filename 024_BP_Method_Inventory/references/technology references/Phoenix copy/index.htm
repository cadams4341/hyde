			<H3>Project Description</H3>
			<p>
				The purpose of this project is:
				<ul>
					<li>
						to elicit system requirements for the
						Phoenix Ambulatory Blood Pressure System
					</li>
				    <li>
						to devise an architecture that satisfies those
						requirements and that is buildable under an open-source
						model
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Systems engineering is not typically applied to open-source
				products but is appropriate to the Phoenix System, which fits
				the conditions of a complex system:
				<blockquote>
					An interacting combination of elements to accomplish a defined objective. These include:
					<ul>
						<li>Hardware (the monitor)</li>
						<li>Software (analysis applications)</li>
						<li>Firmware (monitor OS, monitor applications)</li>
						<li>People (clinical and laboratory roles)</li>
						<li>Information</li>
						<li>Techniques (clinical protocols)</li>
						<li>Facilities (the Halberg Chronobiology Center)</li>
						<li>Services</li>
						<li>Other support elements</li>
					</ul>
					(International Council on System Engineering, <i>System Engineering Handbook</i>)
				</blockquote>
			</p>
			<H3>Project Deliverables</H3>
			<p>
				The deliverables are to be structured and organized so that they
				align with the other Phoenix Projects:
				<ul>
					<li>System requirements specification</li>
					<li>Architectural design description</li>
				</ul>
