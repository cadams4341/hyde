    <dd>The act of flattening.</dd>
    <br />
    <dt id="application-tonometry">applanation tonometry</dt>
    <dd>The act of flattening a surface with a disk and then measuring the reactive tension or pressure against the disk.</dd>
    <br />
    <dt id="auscultation">auscultation</dt>
    <dd>The listening to internal sounds of the body, usually using a stethoscope.</dd>
    <br />
    <dt id="brachial-blood-pressure">brachial blood pressure</dt>
    <dd>The pressure exerted by the blood within the aorta.</dd>
    <br />
    <dt id="central-aortic-pressure">central aortic pressure (CAP). central aortic systolic pressure (CASP)</dt>
    <dd>The pressure exerted by the blood within the aorta.</dd>
    <br />
    <dt id="diastole">diastole</dt>
    <dd>The period of time during which the heart relaxes and refills with blood after <a href="systole">systole</a> (contraction).</dd>
    <br />
    <dt id="diastolic-blood-pressure">diastolic blood pressure (DBP, DP)</dt>
    <dd>The minimum arterial pressure during the relaxation and dilation of the ventricles of the heart when the ventricles fill with blood. In a blood pressure reading, the diastolic pressure is typically the second number recorded. Contrast with <a href="#systolic-blood-pressure">systolic blood pressure</a>.</dd>
    <br />
    <dt id="mean-arterial-pressure">mean arterial pressure (MAP, MBP, MP)</dt>
    <dd>The average blood pressure during a cardiac cycle. Contrast with <a href="#systolic-blood-pressure">systolic blood pressure</a> and with <a href="#diastolic-blood-pressure">diastolic blood pressure</a>.</dd>
    <br />
    <dt id="oscillometry">oscillometry</dt>
    <dd>Measurement of oscillations of any kind. In medicine it is used in studying cardiovascular and respiratory physiology. (Dorland, 28th ed)</dd>
    <br />
    <dt id="pulse">pulse<dt>
    <dd>The throbbing of arteries as an effect of heartbeat.</dd>
    <br />
    <dd>The rate at which the heart beats, as observed and and measured by tactile or visual means on the outside of an artery.</dd>
    <br />
    <dt id="pulse-pressure">pulse pressure (PP)</dt>
    <dd>The difference between the <a href="#systolic-blood-pressure">systolic blood pressure</a> and the <a href="#diastolic-blood-pressure">diastolic blood pressure</a>, which are taken respectively at opposite ends of the cardiac cycle and are a person's highest and lowest blood pressure levels. The pulse pressure represents the force that the heart generates each time it contracts.</dd>
    <br />
    <dd><small>[COMMON] </small>The amount of pressure required to create the feeling of a pulse.</dd>
    <br />
    <dt id="pulse-transit-time">pulse transit time (PTT)</dt>
    <dd>The time that the <a href="#pulse-wave">pulse wave</a> needs for the propagation from the aorta to the peripheral vessels.</dd>
    <br />
    <dd>The time it takes for a <a href="#pulse-wave">pulse wave</a> to travel between two sites on the same artery at different distances from the heart.</dd>
    <br />
    <dd>Pulse transit time is closely connected to blood pressure and the condition of the arterial vessels.</dd>
    
    <br />
    <dt id="pulse-wave">pulse wave</dt>
    <dd>A pressure wave that is generated by the heart in <a href="#systole">systole</a>. A pulse wave causes a <a href="pulse">pulse</a> where arterial walls are sufficiently pliable.</dd>
    <br />
    <dt id="">sphygmology</dt>
    <dd>The study of the <a href="#pulse">pulse</a>.</dd>
    <br />
    <dt id="sphygmomanometer">sphygmomanometer</dt>
    <dd>1. A device used to measure blood pressure, composed of an inflatable cuff to restrict blood flow, and a mercury or mechanical manometer to measure the pressure. It is always used in conjunction with a means to determine at what pressure blood flow is just starting, and at what pressure it is unimpeded.</dd>
    <dd>2. A device used to measure blood pressure, composed of an inflatable cuff, a measuring unit (the mercury manometer, or aneroid gauge), and a mechanism for inflation which may be a manually operated bulb and valve or a pump operated electrically.</dd>
    <dd>See also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphygmomanometer" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphygmomanometer</a>.</dd>
    <br />
    <dt id="systole">systole</dt>
    <dd>The contraction of the left ventricle of the heart.</dd>
    <br />
    <dt id="systolic-blood-pressure">systolic blood pressure (SBP, SP)</dt>
    <dd>The blood pressure when the heart is contracting. Specifically, the maximum arterial pressure during contraction of the left ventricle of the heart. The time at which ventricular contraction occurs is called <a href="#systole">systole</a>. In a blood pressure reading, the systolic pressure is typically the first number recorded. Contrast with <a href="#diastolic-blood-pressure">diastolic blood pressure</a>.</dd>
    <br />
    <dt id="tonometry">tonometry</dt>
    <dd>any technique for measuring pressure or tension</dd>
    <br />
    <dt id="transducer">transducer</dt>
    <dd>an electrical device that converts one form of energy into another</dd>
    <dd>an instrument that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy</dd>
    <dd>a transmitter and receiver of ultrasound information</dd>
