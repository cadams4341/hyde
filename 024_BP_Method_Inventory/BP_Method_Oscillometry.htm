    <h3 id="artery-occluding-methods">Artery-Occluding Methods</h3>
    <p>All the indirect methods documented by Geddes usually involve an occluding cuff. Such a cuff can appear as an arm-band; as an annular cuff on a finger; or as a headband, when applied to the a temporal artery.</p>
    <blockquote>With all of the occlusive methods, one of the most important factors that influences the accuracy attainable is the length of the arterial segment which is compressed. This, in turn, is determined by the width of the occluding cuff. Thus, there is an important relationship between the width of the occluding cuff and the size of the member to which it is applied. [Geddes, p. 101]</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The relationship between the size of the cuff and the member to which it is applied is especially important when the indirect method is applied to children and infants. [Geddes, p. 103]</blockquote>

    <h3 id="oscillometric-method">Oscillometric Method</h3>
    <p>Oscillometric methods of blood pressure measure usually employ an occluding cuff placed over a blood vessel, with something like a manometer for reading the pressure within the cuff. Intra-arterial pulsation is transmitted to the occluding cuff, causing oscillations in the <a href="BP_Method Terms.htm#sphygmomanometer">sphygmomanometer</a> cuff pressure. Starting with the cuff inflated to the point of occluding any pulse and then gradually reducing the counterpressure, systolic pressure is signaled when the pulses (oscillations) appear and diastolic pressure is signaled when the oscillations reach their maximum amplitude.</p>
    <p>At least that was the theory in the early twentieth century. Comparisons of measurements from the oscillometric, <a href="BP_Method_Inventory Geddes.htm#auscultatory-method">auscultatory</a>, and <a href="BP_Method_Inventory Geddes.htm#palpatory-method">palpatory</a> methods indicate the following:[Geddes, p. 93]</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Oscillometric readings are sensitive to cuff size.</li>
    <li>With cuff pressure above systolic pressure, small oscillations can be seen in cuff pressure which are due to the transmission of the arterial pulse that is central to the occluded arterial segment.</li>
    <li>As cuff pressure falls just below systolic pressure, the pulse breaks through the occlusion, and the oscillations in cuff pressure increase in amplitude.</li>
    <li>From this point on, the oscillations get bigger and may or may not reach a maximum; often they do. Frequently, the maximum is extremely sharp. With continued deflation, the oscillations decrease; there is no true identification of diastolic pressure.</li>
    <li>The actual arterial pressure corresponding to the maximum oscillations appears to be nearer the mean arterial pressure than the diastolic pressure.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Despite the fact that the oscillatory criteria have not been validated satisfactorily (at least as of 1970) the method has been used to determine the pressure in arteries other than the brachial, such as in the temporal and opthalmic arteries. A photoelectric sensor has been used in conjunction with the oscillatory method to determine the pressure in the auricular artery, which is in the pinna -- the ear outside the head. The photoelectric devices works because the pulsatile arterial blood flow varies the optical density of the light path.</p>
