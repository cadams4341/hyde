10.4 - Ideal anatomical site for the measurement of the blood pressure

10.4.1 - Anatomical site of reference

The blood pressure must be measured as close as possible to the aorta, the artery which comes out directly from the heart.

Thus, the reference measurement of the blood pressure is established by a measurement at the level of the artery of the arm (humeral artery), because this artery is the closest to the heart and most easily accessible.

10.4.2 - Other sites of measurement

The blood pressure can also be recorded at the level of the arteries of the wrist and even of the fingers. Nevertheless, these sites are by themselves source of error because their distance from the heart is responsible for an artificial rise in the blood pressure.

Moreover, during the measurement, it is very important to place the site of measurement at the level of the heart because gravity is also another source of error.

Indeed, if the subject takes its blood pressure upright, with an outstretched arm along the body, the blood pressure measured at the level of the arm could be raised on an average of 3 millimetres of mercury, whereas if it is measured at the level of the wrist, this increase could be of 15 millimetres of mercury, compared to the blood pressure measured in the aorta!

If the patient is seated, blood pressure variation along the arterial tree is less important, and value of the blood pressure at the brachial site is closed to the value measured at the wrist. For that reason, the device that measure blood pressure at the wrist could perfectly be used in clinical practice.

We thus recommend to choose a self-measurement device of blood pressure, which preferably measures the blood pressure at the level of the arm, or at the wrist, compared to a device measuring the blood pressure at the level the fingers.

Abstract
OBJECTIVE:
Blood pressure is usually measured noninvasively with a cuff on the arm of the leg. Circumstances exist, however, when an alternative site for blood pressure measurement is desirable. This study is designed to identify a location on the forehead where blood pressure can be reliably measured noninvasively.
METHODS:
We mapped the superficial temporal artery and/or the supraorbital artery in 65 volunteers and found a rectangular area where an adhesive pressure pad could be placed over each artery. Oscillometric signals were recorded from four different locations over the forehead in 19 of the 65 volunteers to compare the amplitude of the signal and mean blood pressure between locations.
RESULTS:
The course of the supraorbital artery is quite consistent. It passed through a 2.5- x 1-cm rectangular area on the forehead in all volunteers in which it was mapped. The medial border of the rectangle is 0.5-cm medial and 1-cm above the medial corner of the left eyebrow. The course of the superficial temporal artery differed remarkably from person to person. We could not find an area of reasonable size to cover the artery in all wounds. Mean blood pressures were the same in all forehead locations. The signal was the weakest on the center of the forehead and strongest directly over the superficial temporal artery.
CONCLUSIONS:
Our results show that the supraorbital artery, an end-artery of the internal carotid artery, which emerges through the supraorbital foramen and cross the forehead near the center, is the preferred site to monitor blood pressure noninvasively on the forehead with an adhesive pressure bladder.

Abstract
SUMMARY: The suitability of alternative sites for non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement was investigated in 100 awake healthy volunteers. The calf and the ankle were chosen for comparison with the arm, and the results analysed subjected to Bland-Altman analysis. Discomfort was graded using a Visual Analogue Scale. There was a poor agreement between the different sites with respect to systolic blood pressure: the agreement was closer for diastolic and mean measurements. The mean blood pressure calf measurement was on average 4 mmHg (95% limits of agreement -12 to 20), higher than the arm. The ankle was 8 mmHg higher (-8 to 24) than the arm. ANOVA demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the discomfort scores between the sites (p < 0.001). The calf demonstrated the highest discomfort score and the ankle the lowest. We suggest that the ankle should be considered in preference to the calf as an alternative site for NIBP measurement if use of an arm is undesirable or impossible.
