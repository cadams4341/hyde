  Monitor Project<BR>
  <U>Sub-project: Body Motion Sensor</U></FONT></CENTER></H2>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H3>Project Description</H3>
  <P>The purpose of the project is to build a reliable, low power,
  low cost body motion sensor using MEMs. The sensor will be used
  in conjunction with any ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM)
  and would correlate the general activity level of the human body
  with the blood pressure measurements.</P>
  <P>The project is broken up into two stages.  The first stage
  is to use an existing STAR (Sensing Triple Axis Reference) Board
  manufactured by Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.  <A HREF="http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=RD3112MMA7260Q&nodeId=011269Vhn6&tid=tsft# ">http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=RD3112MMA7260Q&amp;nodeId=011269Vhn6&amp;tid=tsft#
  </A><BR>
  The STAR is a stand-alone battery powered demonstration module
  from Freescale MMA7260Q &plusmn;1.5 g Triple Axis MEMs Accelerometer
  that also contains a MC68HC908KX8 8-bit microprocessor along
  with 16K X 8 memory to store data.  The unit will produce time-sampled
  values of acceleration and load them into memory for later analysis.
   This unit will be used in conjunction with the current ABPM
  to determine:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>The most optimum sampling rate.
    <LI>The potential required motion computational issues.
    <LI>What body movements would produce the most significant impact
    to the ABPM measurements.
  </UL>
  <P>The second stage would take this information to more clearly
  define the requirements for the motion sensor that would integrate
  into the Phoenix ABPM.<BR>
