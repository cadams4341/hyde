  <U>Sub-project: Calibration With A Blood Pressure Cuff</U></FONT></CENTER></H2>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H3>Project Description</H3>
  <P>Most doctors think of the numbers obtained with a blood pressure
  cuff when they think of blood pressure. The ABPM may use light,
  sound, changes in the arm dimensions, electric impedance, or
  some other method to continuously monitor blood pressure. A fundamental
  assumption is that the ABPM will not use a blood pressure cuff
  continuously because continuous occlusion of an artery will destroy
  tissue. A secondary assumption is that the ABPM will not use
  a blood pressure cuff intermittently because very frequent occlusion
  of an artery causes pain.</P>
  <P>Whatever methods are used, the results must relate to blood
  pressure cuff measurements. The ABPM results must relate to blood
  pressure cuff results no matter how much better the ABPM results
  may be.</P>
  <P>Calibration of the ABPM, clinical trial data, and individual
  patient data must always include the blood pressure cuff measurements.</P>
  <P>A separate sphygomanometer can be used. The data can be entered
  into a &quot;personal computer&quot; automatically or manually.
  Then, the blood-pressure-cuff information must be entered into
  the ABPM and / or its special purpose computer.</P>
  <P>Similarly, the sphygmomanometer can be attached to the special
  purpose computer.</P>
  <P>This sub-project will consider a separate sphygomanometer,
  or an attached blood pressure cuff. The sub-project will also
  investigate a sphygmomanometer that has low cost for the &quot;third
  world&quot;.</P>
  <P>Part of the sub-project is the entry of sphygomanometer data,
  the &quot;personal computer&quot; used, the special purpose computer.
  The software for blood pressure cuff data entry is needed. Similarly,
  the software for calibration, clinical, and patient data is considered.
  Also, the information display and transfer is part of the sub-project.</P>
