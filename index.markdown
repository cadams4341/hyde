**Hyde** is an archive of The Phoenix Chronobiology Projects' original website, which resided at `www.phoenix.tc-ieee.org`. That site was retired when the host site was refactored.

This site is intended for read-only access. New or revised content should be written for, or ported to, the Projects' current home site, <a href="https://phoenix-chronobiology.github.io/phoenix-biorhythm-platform/" target="_blank"> https://phoenix-chronobiology.github.io/phoenix-biorhythm-platform/</a>, or one of its child sites.

Links back to the site's home page were edited, to link to this page rather than to the original site.

Links to former team members, or to invalid email addresses, have been disabled.

Links to web pages have not been validated. Some of these links are broken.

Links to other content, such as images, PDF files, and Microsoft Office files, have not been validated. Some of these links are broken.
