  <H3>Project Description</H3>
  <P>The purpose of the low power microprocessor project is to
  identify and build a development environment (dev board plus
  tools) using open source software and a hardware prototype of
  a low power microprocessor and peripherals.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H3>Project Deliverables</H3>
  <UL>
    <LI>Selection of the development environment and microprocessor
    platform.
    <LI>Design of hardware prototype.
    <LI>Design of interface to sensor: RF link.
    <LI>Layout and fabrication of a printed circuit board containing
    the designs
    <LI>Bill of material
    <LI>Evaluation of the completed prototypes.
    <LI>Public invention disclosure and release.
    <LI>A written report.
  </UL>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H3>Project Requirements Needed to Initiate Design</H3>
  <UL>
    <LI>Software requirements (algorithm type, overall processor
    capability in MIPS, memory size, nonvolatile memory requirements).
    <LI>RF link description (range, data rate, enryption required?).
    <LI>Display requirements (size, backlight).
    <LI>Battery lifetime requirements (use case -- for example: receive
    data once per hour, respond to button push 8 times per day, remain
    on 3 minutes).
