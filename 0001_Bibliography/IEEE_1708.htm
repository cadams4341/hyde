    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>IEEE 1708 breaks down to five parts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Device accuracy (performance)</li>
      <li>Wearable sensors</li>
      <li>Communication protocols for networking</li>
      <li>Electrical safety</li>
      <li>Stability</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The standard defines terms pertaining to "Performance Evaluation" but defers other definitions to <i>IEEE Standards Dictionary Online</i>,
    <a href="http://www.ieee.org/portal/innovate/products/standard/standards_dictionary.html">http://www.ieee.org/portal/innovate/products/standard/standards_dictionary.html</a>, which like other IEEE standards is available via subscription.</p>
    <p>
      Though the standard is intended for home blood pressure measurement (HPBM)
      and ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) systems, it does not establish any
      expectations for continuous measurement.
      The performance evaluation standard accounts for any calibration specified by the
      device manufacturer, but leaves the procedure and frequency of calibration
      to the manufacturer.
      
    </p>
    <h4>Device Accuracy (Performance)</h4>
    <p>This section describes how to evaluate the accuracy of a device's measurements.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Observer training</li>
      <li>Subject selection</li>
      <li>Validation procedure</li>
      <li>Validation criteria</li>
      <li>Data reporting</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The standard prescribes the comparison
      of a device's measurements to reference measurements
      taken with a sphygmomanometers.</p>
    <h4>Wearable sensor</h4>
    <p>
      The scope of the standard does not dictate any technology or any form of a device.
      Consequently, this part of the standard is open-ended.
      The device is required only to meet the requirements of the standard
      for the specific kind of sensor under evaluation.
      <p>
    <h4>Communication Protocols for Networking</h4>
    <p>
      The standard provides normative references to other standards, primarily to
      the IEEE-11073 series,
      which addresses personal health device and
      point-of-care medical device communication.
    </p>
    <h4>Electrical Safety</h4>
    <p>
      The standard provides normative references to:
      <ul>
        <li>
          IEC 60601, which governs general electrical safety
          of medical electrical equipment</li>
        <li>ANSI/NFPA 99, which governs flammable anesthetizing locations</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Stability</h4>
    <p>
      The standard provides a normative reference to ANSI/AAMI SP10,
      which governs sphygmomanometers. Within the context of that standard,
      stability pertains to attributes of the system to maintain its
      performance and safety attributes over the life of any battery within the system
      and over the life of the device,
      as measured by the number of full-scale pressure cycles.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to stability, SP10 seems inadequate to the demands of
      ambulatory blood pressure monitors, particularly those intended to meet the demands
      of chronobiological analysis. The standard sets the expected lifetime of a device
      to 10,000 full-scale pressure cycles. This would encompass less than 7 months of use
      when measuring every 30 minutes.
