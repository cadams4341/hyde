  <U>Regulations on Medical Data</U></FONT></CENTER></H2>
  <P><CENTER><B>Disclaimer: all commentary on this page regarding
  FDA, HHS and WHO regulations are the opinion of the author.</B></CENTER></P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Regulatory agencies around the world differ on their requirements
  for the handling of medical records. For example, the World Heath
  Organization (WHO) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
  have different standards. However, in terms of medical devices
  most regulatory bodies have similar requirements. That is, they
  are generally more concerned that the product, procedure or service
  does not harm the patient, rather than if it meets any particular
  specifications. Enforcement of product specifications is generally
  left up to the device manufacturer (i.e. the industry).</P>
  <P>In the United States the regulatory issue is further complicated
  by the fact that some medical data is controlled by the Food
  and Drug Administration, and some by the Department of Health
  and Human Serivces (HHS).</P>
  <H3><CENTER>US Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) Regulations</CENTER></H3>
  <P>In the United States, regulations regarding medical devices
  are enforced by the Food and Drug Administration through Section
  21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR). The regulations
  vary in terms of the application of the data, with medical devices
  being most concerned with diagnostic, calibration and design
  history file records. Copies of the regulations can be found
  on-line from the <A HREF="http://www.gpo.gov/">US Government
  Printing Office web site (www.gpo.gov)</A>.</P>
  <P>The regulations vary from device-to-device, and generally
  depend on how it affects the patient if it fails. Devices are
  rated using a three tiered class system, where Class I has the
  least rigorous testing requirements and Class III has the greatest.
  Table 1 broadly describes the three classes.</P>

      Class I devices are subject to the least regulatory control.
      They present minimal potential for harm to the user and are often
      simpler in design than Class II or Class III devices. Examples
      of Class I devices include elastic bandages, examination gloves,
      and hand-held surgical instruments.</TD>

      <TD WIDTH="82%">
      Class II devices are those for which general controls alone are
      insufficient to assure safety and effectiveness, and existing
      methods are available to provide such assurances. Examples of
      Class II devices include powered wheelchairs, infusion pumps,
      and surgical drapes.</TD>

      <TD WIDTH="82%">
      Class III is the most stringent regulatory category for devices.
      Class III devices are usually those that support or sustain human
      life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment
      of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk
      of illness or injury. Examples of Class III devices include implantable
      pacemaker pulse generators and replacement heart valves.</TD>

  <H3>Regulations under 21 CFR 820.30 (FDA): Design Validation</H3>
  <P>Section 21 CFR 820.30 mandates that a design history file
  (DHF) be kept for all medical devices. The purpose of this file
  is to maintain procedures and records that control the design
  of the device. This assures that design requirements are met
  . Section (g) specifies that every medical device must undergo
  a design validation:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#990000">21 CFR 820.30(g) Design validation.
    <U>Each manufacturer shall establish and maintain procedures
    for validating the device design.</U> Design validation shall
    be performed under defined operating conditions on initial production
    units, lots, or batches, or their equivalents. Design validation
    shall ensure that devices conform to defined user needs and intended
    uses and shall include testing of production units under actual
    or simulated use conditions. Design validation shall include
    software validation and risk analysis, where appropriate. <U>The
    results of the design validation, including identification of
    the design, method(s), the date, and the individual(s) performing
    the validation, shall be documented in the DHF.</U></FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H3>Regulations under 21 CFR 820.70 (FDA): Production &amp; Process
  Controls</H3>
  <P>Section 21 CFR 820.70 covers the production and process control
  quality of medical devices. Section (i) is particularly relevant
  to the software validation process as it specifies that:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><BR>
    <FONT COLOR="#990000">21 CFR 820.70(i) Automated processes. When
    computers or automated data processing systems are used as part
    of production or the quality system, <U>the manufacturer shall
    validate computer software for its intended use</U> according
    to an established protocol. All software changes shall be validated
    before approval and issuance. These validation activities and
    results shall be documented.</FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H3>Regulations under 21 CFR Part 11 (FDA): Electronic Records</H3>
  <P>Section 21, Part 11 of the Code of Federal Regulations (FDA/HHS)
  generally covers electronic records and signatures used for medical
  records. It can also be viewed as the mechanism (procedure) for
  turning uncontrolled documents are into legal documents that
  have an auditable paper trail. An excellent source of this information
  can be found on-line at: <A HREF="http://www.21cfrpart11.com/">http://www.21cfrpart11.com/</A>.</P>
  <P>For example, software source codes obtained from public sources
  (e.g. Linux operating system components) are considered uncontrolled
  documents. However, once the software is validated for use in
  a medical device they must be controlled under the provisions
  of 21 CFR Part 11. At that point they are considered legal documents
  with an auditable paper trail.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H3>Types of Records</H3>
  <P>While these regulations are generally thought of as pertaining
  to diagnostic records (e.g. blood pressure data), they are used
  for all types of data as listed in the regulations, including
  records in the design history file. This includes documents such
  as validated software source code, manuals, reports and so forth.
  Section 21 CFR 11.1(b) specifies that:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#990000">21 CFR 11.1(b) Scope (partial quote).
    <U>This part applies to records in electronic form that are created,
    modified, maintained, archived, retrieved, or transmitted, under
    any records requirements set forth in agency regulations.</U>
    This part also applies to electronic records submitted to the
    agency under requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
    Act and the Public Health Service Act, even if such records are
    not specifically identified in agency regulations. However, this
    part does not apply to paper records that are, or have been,
    transmitted by electronic means.</FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H3>Audit Trail</H3>
  <P>Each medical record must maintain an audit trail. In general,
  the audit trail is attached to the data and is made part of the
  record itself. This can include data such as:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Who entered the data?
    <LI>What instrument was used to collect the data (e.g. type,
    set-up and calibration)?
    <LI>Where was the data taken and where was it maintained?
    <LI>Time stamp.
    <LI>All modified or deleted records (e.g. log file).
    <LI>Much more, including controls (see 21 CFR 11.10(e-l))&#133;
    <LI>Signature
  </UL>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H3>Signature (Paper or Electronic)</H3>
  <P>All documents must be signed by their respective owner, either
  by paper (handwritten) or electronic means. The signature must
  be linked to the data record. This is an important part of the
  audit trail because it establishes and verifies that an authorized
  entity (person or corporation) created the document. If electronic
  signatures are used, then minimum requirements for authentication
  of individuals are presented as well.<BR>
  </P>
  <H3>Open and Closed Systems</H3>
  <P>21 CFR Part 11 defines controls for two types of systems:
  closed and open. A closed system is one where system access is
  controlled by the persons who are responsible for the content
  of records that are in that system. For example, if files are
  maintained by a company on its own computer using its own software
  and personnel, then it's a closed system. If the files are maintained
  on someone else's system (e.g. via the internet), then it's an
  open system.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H3><CENTER>US Health &amp; Human Serivces (HHS) Regulations</CENTER></H3>
  <P>In the United States some medical data regulations are controlled
  by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). These
  are covered under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
  Act (HIPPA). Relavant sections include 45 CFR parts 160 and 164:
  <I>Standards for privacy of individuals</I>. A good resource
  of information about HIPAA regulations can be found at: <A HREF="http://www.ihs.gov/">http://www.ihs.gov/</A>.</P>
