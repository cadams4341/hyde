        Still too early to give much consideration about components, but
        the solution will probably be built on the Java platform, with
        consideration for one of the following frameworks:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.netbeans.org/products/platform/index.html">NetBeans Platform</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        We would like a comparison of these two frameworks, particularly within
        contexts similar to that of the Phoenix Project, such as
        <a href="http://bioinf.gla.ac.uk/biobeans/">BioBeans.org</a>, which is
        developing an integrated data analysis environment for biologists.
