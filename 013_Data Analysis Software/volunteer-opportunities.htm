								Catalog the reference data collected, and the algorithms developed,

									<li>Entails visits to the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities.</li>

										<ul>
											<li>In many different languages</li>
											<li>On a variety of media</li>
											<li>For a variety of operating systems</li>
											<li>With a variety of logical designs</li>
										</ul>

									<li>Following this task will be opportunities to:
										<ol>
											<li>Archive the various data in a common medium</li>
											<li>Normalize the data into a single repository</li>
										</ol>

								Assess NetBeans and Eclipse as possible graphical user interface (GUI) frameworks for the:
								<ul>
									<li>data analysis workstation</li>
									<li>baseline data management workstation</li>
								</ul>
							</td>
							<td>
								<p>Because both of these toolkits are implemented in Java, this task
								also entails assessing Java as the implementation language for the data analysis software.</p>
								<p>This task is not concerned with the NetBeans and Eclipse integrated development environments (IDEs),
								but with the platforms on which the IDEs are built.</p>

							<td>Preliminary software requirements for the computing components within the device itself.</td>
							<td>
								<p>
									The device is essentially a data acquisition system
									(as in "supervisory control and data acquisition"
									without the supervisory control).
								</p>
								<p>Linux on a chip?</p>
								<p>Some prototyping would be instructive.</p>
								<p>
								This task could probably be the first step in, or lead to, a separate subproject.
								Before doing so, be sure the objectives do not overlap those of the
								<a href="../007_Low_Power_Microprocessor/Low_Power_Microprocessor.htm">Low Power Microprocessor subproject</a>.
								</p>

						<tr>
							<td>4</td>
							<td>Verification and validation planning</td>
							<td>
								<p>This is a leadership opportunity.</p>
								<p>
								Because our product is a medical device, we need
								testing that is formal and is independent of development.
								Some planning now (rather than later) will help assure that our developers
								build a testable product and produce information needed by our testers.
								</p>
								<p>
								This task is also an opportunity to influence whether and how a test-driven development methodology be adopted.

						<tr>
							<td>5</td>
							<td>Separate systems engineering from software engineering</td>
							<td>
								<p>
								Re-organize the Data Analysis Software subproject into multiple subprojects.
								In particular, create a systems engineering subproject in recognition that:
								<ul>
									<li>Most of the requirements effort thus far is oriented to system-level issues</li>
									<li>We need to specify user requirements at the system level</li>
									<li>Verification and validation is executated at the system level and consequently needs a system level requirements specificaton</li>
								</ul>
