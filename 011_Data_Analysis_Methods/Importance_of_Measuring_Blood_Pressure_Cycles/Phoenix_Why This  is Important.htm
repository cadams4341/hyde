  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>A goal of the Halberg Chronobiology Center is to obtain an
  Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor suitable for long-term use,
  encourage its use on a massive scale to obtain measures in health,
  and to encourage the development of diagnostic, preventive and
  therapeutic techniques. Reliable measurements are important for
  the correct diagnosis to be made because abnormalities in blood
  pressure and heart rate are usually asymptomatic until there
  is target organ damage.</P>
  <P>Their data suggest that repeated measurements of blood pressure
  and heart rate, collected around the clock for a week or longer,
  can yield a more reliable diagnosis than one based on single
  measurements as done conventionally: patients who tend to have
  high blood pressure values in the physician's office due to anxiety
  would be spared unneeded medication, and patients with high blood
  pressure at times other than that of the physical examination
  would be identified and receive the benefit of any needed treatment.
  This relates in particular to patients who may escape the medication's
  effect during the night when they are not likely to be seen by
  a physician.</P>
  <P>The assessment of the variability in blood pressure and heart
  rate also leads to an improved diagnosis, since some abnormalities
  of the circadian patterns in blood pressure and heart rate are
  associated with a large increase in cardiovascular disease risk,
  even when most or all of the measurements are in the acceptable
  range. By recognizing an elevated risk before there is overt
  disease, preventive action can be taken, thereby reducing the
  likelihood of catastrophic disease such as a heart attack, stroke,
  kidney disease or retinopathy, thereby also reducing health care
  costs.</P>
  <P>When the blood pressure and heart rate measurements are compared
  with time-specified reference values that are further qualified
  by gender and age, information is gained regarding the nature
  and extent of abnormality as well as the timing of its occurrence,
  so that treatment can be timed to properly target the times of
  most excess. Treatment can thus be individualized by the timing
  of its administration. Treatment can also be optimized by specific
  drug effects affecting the variability of blood pressure and
  heart rate, quite apart from any effect on their mean value.</P>
  <P>Measurements of blood pressure and heart rate and the assessment
  of their predictable variability (see <A HREF="../../000_Background/Phoenix_About_Our_Logo.htm#anchor63987">graph</A>)
  can be made possible if these variables are measured automatically
  around the clock for at least 7 days. This is best achieved by
  means of an automatic ambulatory monitoring device that is easily
  available for everyone.<BR>
