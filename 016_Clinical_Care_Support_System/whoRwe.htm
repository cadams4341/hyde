<p>The Clinical Care Support Systems (CCSS) study group is a volunteer
organization which operates under the <a href="http://www.ieee.org">Institute
for Electrical and Electronic Engineers</a>.&nbsp; At the present time, the
volunteers are all from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, which is why you find our
web page listed under the <a href="http://www.tc-ieee.org/">Twin Cities Section
of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers</a>.&nbsp; The CCSS was
initially spun off from the <a href="http://www.phoenix.tc-ieee.org/">Phoenix
project</a> as a volunteer group to help individuals in developing countries
understand and use measurements of blood pressure in the absence of a physician
or nurse.&nbsp; Our mission has since expanded to include other ways in which
software systems can be used to help improve care and save costs in the
healthcare and to provide a partial solution to healthcare in the developing
world.</p>
