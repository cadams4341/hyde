  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H3>Project Description</H3>
  <P>The purpose of the IEEE Clinical Care Support Systems (CCSS)
  study group is to facilitate discussions and research into open
  source solutions to clinical software systems. Topics of primary
  interest are Clinical Information Systems, Electronic Medical
  Records systems, Decision Support Systems, Expert Systems, Clinical
  Guidelines and Computer-Interpretable clinical Guidelines.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H3>Project Deliverables</H3>
  <UL>
    <LI>A report or reports comparing existing open-source Clinical
    Information Systems including discussions of the state of existing
    projects indicating where improvements are needed and the prospects
    for improvements.
    <LI>A report or reports on the results of a survey of human factors
    studies of interfaces to CCSS including results of any study
    performed by the IEEE CCSS study group. Prepare software specifications
    for various types of CCSS user interfaces. Write software for
    open-source user-interfaces for various types of CCSS.
    <LI>A report or reports describing efforts to harmonize standards
    used for describing patients and efforts to harmonize standards
    used for describing computer-interpretable clinical guidelines
    and disease. Participate in the harmonization effort if appropriate.
    <LI>Promote open source CCSS and funding of open source CCSS
    and development of the infrastructure to facilitate open source
    CCSS.
    <LI>Prepare/facilitate computer interpretable clinical guidelines
    in support of the Phoenix project. Guideline prepared to be compatible
    with EGADSS open source decision support system.<BR>
  </UL>
  <H3>Initial tasks</H3>
  <UL>
    <LI>Collect and evaluate information on existing open source
    efforts to develop Clinical Information Systems.
    <LI>Collect and evaluate information on ASTM and HL7 standards
    used for describing patients and information on the ANSI effort
    to harmonize the two standards.
    <LI>Collect and evaluate information on standards for describing
    computer interpretable guidelines and the efforts to evaluate
    or harmonize the standards.
    <LI>Collect and evaluate existing human factors studies for CCSS
    interfaces.
    <LI>Promote a federal effort to convert existing clinical guidelines
    into computer interpretable clinical guidelines as part of upcoming
    Health IT legislation planned for fall 2005.<BR>
