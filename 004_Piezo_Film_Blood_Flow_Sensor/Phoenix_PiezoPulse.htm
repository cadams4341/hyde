  <H3>Project Description</H3>
  <P>The purpose of the piezo film pulse sensor project is to identify
  and build a reliable, low power, low cost blood flow sensor.
  The sensor is intended for two proposed designs for the ambulatory
  blood pressure monitor (ABPM). They are: (a) an oscillometric
  cuff design (as a Korotkoff sound sensor) and (b) the blood flow
  velocity design. The project includes the following deliverables:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Selection of the piezo film sensing element(s).
    <LI>Design of a sensing circuit, including filtering and amplification
    stages.
    <LI>Layout and fabrication of a small, low noise circuit board.
    <LI>Bill of material
    <LI>Evaluation of the completed sensor system.
    <LI>Public invention disclosure and release.
    <LI>A written report.

  <H3>Piezo Film Sensor Element</H3>
  <P>The piezo film sensor element selected for this test was the
  SDT1-028K made by <A HREF="http://www.msiusa.com/">Measurement
  Specialties, Inc.</A> It was selected because (a) it is very
  sensitive to low level mechanical movements, (b) it has an electrostatic
  shield located on both sides of the element (to minimize 50/60
  Hz AC line interference), (c) it is responsive to low frequency
  movements in the 0.7 - 12 Hz range of interest, (d) the foil
  size was about right (1 inch / 2.54 cm long) and (e) it has an
  integral connector and cable for simple connections. The sensor
  is shown in Figure 1. An RG-174 BNC connector was attached to
  the opposite end of the cable (not shown).</P>

  <H3>Filter/Amplifier Circuit</H3>
  <P>The filter/amplifier circuit shown in Figure 2 was created
  for the piezo film sensor. It was specifically designed for battery
  powered operation from three <A HREF="http://www.phoenix.tc-ieee.org/003_Batteries/Phoenix_Batteries.htm">AA
  or AAA cells</A> (3.6 - 4.5 VDC), and consumes just 100 uA of
  current. The BNC connector located on the left side of the board
  connects to the piezo film sensor. The output is monitored with
  oscilloscope probe(s) via test points located on the board. The
  board dimensions are 2.5 inch (6.4 cm) x 3.8 inch (9.7 cm).</P>

  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><U>Figure 2. Filter/amplifier circuit.</U></CENTER></P>
  <P>The circuit has a three-pole low pass filter with a lower
  (-3 dB) cutoff frequency at about 12-13 Hz. The main purpose
  of the low-pass filter is to prevent unwanted 50/60 Hz AC line
  interference from entering the sensor. However, the piezo film
  element has a wide band frequency response so the filter also
  attenuates any extraneous sound waves or vibrations that get
  into the piezo element. The DC gain is about +30 dB. <A HREF="Resources/PiezoAmpBodePlot.pdf">Click
  here to see the Bode plot</A> of the circuit (i.e. the frequency
  response).</P>
  <P>The circuit has a very high input impedance. Applications
  notes from Measurement Specialties, Inc. report that the low-end
  frequency response of the piezo film can be lowered from 5-6
  Hz to 0.7 Hz by using a 10 Megohm or higher input impedance.
  The front end of the filter/amplifier circuit uses an op-amp
  follower in parallel with a 10 Megohm parallel resistor.</P>
  <P>Complete documentation for the circuit is given here, including
  a <A HREF="Resources/PiezoAmpSchematic.pdf">schematic diagram</A>,
  <A HREF="Resources/PiezoAmpBOM.pdf">bill of material (BOM)</A>
  and PCB artwork. All parts (except for the PCB artwork) can be
  ordered on-line from Digi-key Corporation at <A HREF="http://www.digi-key.com/">www.digi-key.com</A>.
  The PCB artwork can be modified and ordered on-line from ExpressPCB
  at <A HREF="http://www.expresspcb.com/">www.expresspcb.com</A>.
  Just download their free CAD software and the board artwork file
  named <A HREF="Resources/PiezoAmp.pcb">PiezoAmp.pcb</A>. The
  board conforms to the specifications for their low cost 'miniboard'
  service. The board assembly uses surface mounted components and
  can be hand assembled with the aide of a small soldering iron
  and a microscope.<BR>

  <H3>Wrist Pulse Response</H3>
  <P>The piezo film was attached to the wrist with cloth athletic
  tape. The sensor was placed over the pulse point as shown in
  Figure 3. The adhesive on this tape is designed to be attached
  to the skin, and is breathable. It's a fairly weak adhesive which
  also allows the tape to be removed without damage to the piezo
  element.</P>

  athletic tape.</U></CENTER></P>
  <P>Figures 4 and 5 signal response from the filter/amplifier
  circuit when the sensor is placed over the wrist. Figure 4 is
  a single sweep waveform as obtained from an HP 54615B storage
  oscilloscope. Figure 5 uses the same configuration, except that
  the output signal is averaged over 64 waveform samples. The vertical
  and horizontal scales for the two waveforms are identical, with
  a horizontal sweep of 200 mS/div, and a voltage gain of 100 mV/div.
  All measurements were obtain at test point TP3 shown on the PCB
  schematic diagram.</P>

  <P><CENTER><U>Figure 5. The wrist pulse waveform averaged over
  64 samples.</U></CENTER></P>
  <P>Waveform averaging is a well known noise reduction technique.
  It reinforces the waveform of interest by minimizing the effect
  of any random noise. These pulses were obtained when the arm
  was motionless. If the arm was moved while capturing the data
  the waveform did not look nearly as clean. That's because motion
  of the arm causes the sonic vibrations to enter the piezo film
  through the arm or by way of the cable.<BR>
  </P>
  <H3>Mid-arm Response</H3>
  <P>The piezo sensor was moved from the wrist to the mid forearm
  area. The response there was less dramatic as shown in Figure
  6. In this case the piezo film is probably picking up the acoustic
  sound wave rather than any physical motion of the skin surface.
  This is an area that needs improvement because the acoustic sound
  waves are probably more valuable in the measurement system, because
  they permit simplified attachment to the skin.</P>

  <H3>Blood Velocity Response Between Elbow and Wrist</H3>
  <P>Two identical piezo film sensors and filter/amplifier circuits
  were configured as a non-invasive velocity type blood pressure
  monitor. The first sensor was located on the inner left elbow
  at the same location where Korotkoff sounds are monitored during
  traditional blood pressure measurements with a spygmometer. The
  second sensor was located on the left wrist as described above
  (about 12 inch / 30cm from each other). Figure 7 shows the results.</P>

  <H3><A NAME="anchor7380"></A>Correlation Between Pulse Delay
  &amp; Blood Pressure</H3>
  <P>The correlation between pulse delay and blood pressure is
  well known in the art of non-invasive blood pressure monitors.
  Some of the best descriptions of this phenominon can be found
  in several US Patents, including those listed in the <A HREF="http://www.phoenix.tc-ieee.org/Phoenix_Patents.htm">Phoenix
  patent references</A> under the heading of <I>Non-invasive Blood
  Pressure Monitors Using Pulse Velocity Methods.</I> These can
  be found via the hotlinks located at the top of the same page.
  Several techniques are described in those patents including relative
  pulse delay, EKG to pressure pulse delay and pulse width.</P>
  <P>One of the best patent references is Chen et. al, US Patent
  No. 6,599,251. Besides being an excellent summary of prior art
  in the field of non-invasive blood pressure measurement, Chen
  descripbes how blood pressure measurements are obtained using
  the pulse delay technique, as well as his data correlating pulse
  delay and pressure. However, Chen uses optoelectric sensors rather
  than the piezo film elements that are shown in this page. It
  is believed by the author that good, non-invasive blood pressure
  sensors using the techniques described on this page can be designed
  around Chen's claims. <BR>
  </P>
  <H3>Conclusions</H3>
  <P>The data show that piezo film can simultaneously monitor two
  pulse signals located at a fixed distance from each other. This
  forms a two-point blood velocity monitor that can be adapted
  for the measurement of blood pressure. The data show that a 12
  inch (30 cm) span results in a time lag of about 32 milliseconds.</P>
  <P>The technique worked quite well, but does need improvement.
  Additional experimentation is needed. The following ideas have
  been generated by the Phoenix group:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Use a smaller piezo element for improved signal-to-noise
    ratio.<BR>
    <LI>Use a piezo cable. It is hoped that this will improve the
    sonic sensitivity (over the current sensitivity to mechanical
    movement).<BR>
    <LI>Attenuate extraneous acoustic vibrations that are transmitted
    up the cable. Layers of 'Silly-putty', 'fun-tak' and Sorbathane(tm)
    are good candidates for sonic absorbing materials that could
    be attached to the cable.<BR>
    <LI>Use an acoustic coupling compound (such as K-Y jelly) between
    the skin and the piezo film element.<BR>
