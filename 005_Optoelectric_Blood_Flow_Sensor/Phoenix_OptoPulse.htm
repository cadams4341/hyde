  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H3>Project Description</H3>
  <P>The purpose of the optoelectric pulse sensor project is to
  identify and build a reliable, low power, low cost blood flow
  sensor. The sensor will be used in two proposed designs for the
  ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM). They are: (a) the oscillometric
  cuff design (as a Korotkoff sound sensor) and (b) the blood flow
  velocity design.</P>
  <P>Measures a heartbeat pulse using an infrared LED/photo transistor
  pair. These sensors are most commonly used in pulse oximetry
  type equipment as described in Chen et. al US Patent No. 6,599,251
  starting at column 5, line 47. Figure 4 of the same patent shows
  a typical front-end circuit.</P>
  <P>Typical optoelectronic (infrared) LEDs and phototransistors
  are available from <A HREF="http://www.optekinc.com/">Optek Technology,
  Inc.</A> The devices used in Chen et. al are the Optek OP140A
  infrared LED and the Optek OP55A infrared NPN phototransistor.</P>
