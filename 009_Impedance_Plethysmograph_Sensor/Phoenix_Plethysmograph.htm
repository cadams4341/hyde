  <U>Sub-project: Impedance Plethysmograph Sensor</U></FONT></CENTER></H2>
  <P><CENTER>By Wade D. Peterson</CENTER></P>
  <H3>Project Description</H3>
  <P>A device called an <I>Impedance Plethysmograph</I> measures
  the impedance of body tissue in response to blood flow. This
  sub-project attempts to use an impedance plethysmograph sensor
  to determine when a blood pulse moves past one or more a fixed
  points. The idea is to measure the blood pressure using one of
  several pulse velocity methods. Ideally, the sensor would be
  located on the upper arm at the same relative height as the heart.</P>
  <P>An excellent description of the impedance plethysmograph can
  be found on-line in <A HREF="http://butler.cc.tut.fi/~malmivuo/bem/bembook/25/25.htm"><I>Bioelectromagnetism</I>
  by Malmivuo and Plonsey</A>. Another excellent reference is entire
  March 1989 issue of <I><U>IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology
  Magazine</U></I>.</P>
  <P>The correlation between pulse delay and blood pressure is
  well known in the art of non-invasive blood pressure monitors.
  Some of the best descriptions of this phenomenon can be found
  in several US Patents, including those listed in the <A HREF="http://www.phoenix.tc-ieee.org/Phoenix_Patents.htm">Phoenix
  patent references</A> under the heading of <I>Non-invasive Blood
  Pressure Monitors Using Pulse Velocity Methods.</I> These can
  be found via the hotlinks located at the top of the same page.
  Several techniques are described in those patents including relative
  pulse delay, EKG to pressure pulse delay and pulse width.</P>
  <P>Two patents that are of particular interest in the field of
  non-invasive, impedance plethysmograph blood pressure sensors
  are Asada et al. PATIENT MONITORING FINGER RING SENSOR (US patent
  No. 5,964,701) and Yang et al. CUFFLESS CONTINUOUS BLOOD PRESSURE
  MONITOR (US patent No. 6,413,223). Both pertain to the use of
  impedance plethysmograph sensors that are attached to the ring
  finger. It is believed by the author that it would be simple
  to design around the claims of both patents. This makes them
  ideal candidates for use by the Phoenix project.</P>
  <P>Both Asada et al. and Yang et. al use the impedance plethysmograph
  method to measure blood flow (and velocity). However, both techniques
  rely on the pulse velocity method which is best described by
  Chen et. al, CONTINUOUS NON-INVASIVE BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING
  METHOD AND APPARATUS (US Patent No. 6,599,251). Besides being
  an excellent summary of prior art in the field of non-invasive
  blood pressure measurement, Chen describes how blood pressure
  measurements are obtained using the pulse delay technique, as
  well as his data correlating pulse delay and pressure. However,
  Chen uses optoelectric sensors rather than the impedance plethysmograph
  shown on this page. It is believed by the author that good, non-invasive
  blood pressure sensors using an impedance plethysmograph can
  be designed around Chen's claims.</P>
  <H3>Initial Experimentation</H3>
  <P>Some early experiments were conducted on an impedance plethysmograph
  suitable for an ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM). The
  initial experimental set-up is shown in Figure 1. There, four
  circuilar band electrodes were arranged along the upper left
  fore-arm of a test subject. The electrodes were made from strips
  of 1/2&quot; adhesive copper (EMI) tape, 3M number 1181 (available
  on-line from <A HREF="http://www.digi-key.com/">Digi-key</A>).
  A signal generator was connected to the outer two bands, and
  an amplifier circuit to the inner two. Smooth-jaw alligator clips
  connected the electronics to the electrodes. A schematic diagram
  of the experimental set-up in 'pdf' form is available <A HREF="Resources/ImpPlethesTest_19NOV2004.pdf">here</A>.</P>

  <P>The copper foil tape electrodes worked surprisingly well,
  especially given the fact that they are extremely low cost. They
  stuck to the skin very well, did not produce any rash or redness,
  and appears to have good electrical conductivity between the
  alligator clips and the skin.</P>
  <P>The signal generator was adjusted for sinewave operation over
  a frequency range of zero to 1.0 MHz, with optimum coupling between
  the excitation and pick-up circuit at around 100 KHz. Voltages
  between zero and 3.0 Vrms were used.</P>
  <P>The test did not produce satisfatory results in that a pulse
  wave could not be detected at the amplifier output. The problem
  appears to be with its low pass filter, which (as it turns out)
  is inappropriate for this application. An <A HREF="../004_Piezo_Film_Blood_Flow_Sensor/Phoenix_PiezoPulse.htm">amplifier
  designed for use with piezo foil</A> was used, which has a low
  pass cutoff frequency below 20 Hz. A new amplifier will be designed
  with a bandpass filter around 100 KHz. This will have the benefit
  of rejecting all noise outside of the passband, especially 50/60
  Hz line noise. Furhtermore, the new circuit should include a
  detector circuit with 20 Hz low pass filter for discrimination
  of the blood flow signal.</P>
