  <U>Objectives</U></FONT></CENTER></H2>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>A goal of the <A HREF="http://www.msi.umn.edu/~halberg/">Halberg
  Chronobiology Center</A> is to obtain an Ambulatory Blood Pressure
  Monitor suitable for long term use, encourage its use on a massive
  scale to obtain measures in health, and to encourage the development
  of diagnostic, prevention and treatment techniques.</P>
  <P>They believe that changes in blood pressure cycles can be
  used to prevent and treat hypertension, heart attack, stroke,
  kidney disease, retinopathy, and other major handicapping and
  fatal diseases. Measurements of blood pressure cycles (see <A
  HREF="Phoenix_About_Our_Logo.htm#anchor63987">graph</A>) can
  be analyzed if they are continued for at least 7 days with automatic
  ambulatory monitoring that is easily available for everyone.
  This will enable people to receive treatment who would never
  be treated, reduce the debilitating side-effects of unnecessary
  medication, make visible critical symptoms that do not occur
  during physician visits, detect the onset of the vascular diseases
  which often do not have easily visible symptoms, and greatly
  reduce the enormous healthcare cost of catastrophic events by
  preventing them. (<A HREF="../011_Data_Analysis_Methods/Importance_of_Measuring_Blood_Pressure_Cycles/Phoenix_Why%20This%20%20is%20Important.htm">click

  <P>The Phoenix Project will develop the monitor. It will focus
  on product development and launch. The Phoenix Measurement Program
  will encourage the monitor to be used to obtain measures of normal
  health. It will focus on public health and policy. The Phoenix
  Clinical Program will encourage the use of the monitor in diagnosis,
  prevention and treatment. It will focus on clinical practice
  and services. <BR>
  </P>
  <H3>Purpose of the Phoenix Project</H3>
  <P>The Phoenix Project is a study group of the <A HREF="http://www.tc-ieee.org/">Twin
  Cities IEEE</A> to develop an ambulatory blood pressure monitor
  for the <A HREF="http://www.msi.umn.edu/~halberg/">Halberg Chronobiology
  Center</A> at the University of Minnesota. Our goal is to make
  a monitor that is <A HREF="#anchor77092">inexpensive</A>, <A
  HREF="#anchor77596">unobtrusive</A>, <A HREF="#anchor77951">easy
  to use</A> and collects a <A HREF="#anchor79168">week of blood
  pressure measurements</A>.</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor77092"></A>&nbsp;*<B> Inexpensive</B><BR>
  Price should be low enough that it is not a barrier to using
  the monitor. It should be less expensive than the blood pressure
  cuff. It should be less expensive than a wrist watch, less than
  $50. In order to become third-world friendly, we thought it should
  be less than &quot;two bushels of yams.&quot; We would like it
  to be $10 or less.</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor77596"></A><B>* Unobtrusive</B><BR>
  The monitor should be able to be placed on a patient, and they
  can forget about it and not be aware of it. It should be no more
  encumbering that a wrist watch, a bandaid or a piece of jewelry.</P>
  <P>It should be able to be used wherever the patient is, such
  as at home or at work when allowed. It should not be usable only
  at a hospital, clinic or doctor's office.</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor77951"></A><B>* Easy to Use</B><BR>
  'The monitor should be easier to use than current devices relying
  on the blood pressure cuff while providing measurements of equal
  accuracy. The patient should be able to ignore it, but it is
  desirable for them to be able to determine that it is functioning
  normally and observe a blood pressure and heart rate measurement
  if they wish.</P>
  <P>It should be automatic, so that measurements will be taken
  regardless of patient behavior. Also, it should allow manually
  initiated measurements.</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor79168"></A><B>* Week of Blood Pressure Measurements</B><BR>
  The monitor should record measurements at least every half hour
  for at least 7 days. We want to measure systolic and diastolic
  blood pressure, and heart rate. Additionally, we would like to
  measure physical activity to determine if vigorous body movement,
  such as physical exercise, influenced the blood pressure measurement;
  and we would like to measure blood flow. See the <A HREF="../Phoenix_Bibliography.htm#anchor75992">bibliography
  article</A> describing the rationale for measuring blood pressure
  for 7 days. <BR>
