  <P>The Phoenix Project is a study group of the <A HREF="http://www.tc-ieee.org/">Twin
  Cities IEEE</A> to develop an ambulatory blood pressure monitor
  for the <A HREF="http://www.msi.umn.edu/~halberg/">Halberg Chronobiology
  Center</A> at the University of Minnesota. Our goal is to make
  a monitor that is <A HREF="Phoenix_Objectives.htm#anchor77092">inexpensive</A>,
  <A HREF="Phoenix_Objectives.htm#anchor77596">unobtrusive</A>,
  <A HREF="Phoenix_Objectives.htm#anchor77951">easy to use</A>
  and collects a <A HREF="Phoenix_Objectives.htm#anchor79168">week
  of blood pressure measurements</A>.</P>
  <P>Our Logo is composed of a Microsoft clip-art drawing showing
  the interior of a human heart and some of the blood vessels,
  an abstract electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing in red and an abstract
  week-long systolic blood pressure cycle in blue, provided by
  the Halberg Chronobiology Center (drawn along two different time
  scales!). The logo symbolizes the investigation of variation
  in blood pressure.</P>
  <P>Franz Halberg notes &quot;The magnifying lens refers to the
  analyses, currently available for all comers from Germaine Corn&eacute;lissen
  at <A HREF="mailto:corne001@umn.edu?Subject=About-Our-Logo">corne001@umn.edu</A>
  carried out in the light of a special data base and special software
  available and used in her center. The data collection for 7 days
  is not even half of the story. All data can be normal in terms
  of being below target values such as 130 mmHg systolic pressure
  (when the heart contracts) but if the swing is excessive, yet
  occurs within a &quot;normal range&quot;, there can still be
  an elevated risk. This change in variability is what should be
  treated to avoid a severe event such as a stroke or myocardial
  infarction.&quot;</P>
  <P>There is no justification in the new millennium (with its
  monitoring and analyzing technology available) for a so-called
  time-unqualified normal range -- for reliance upon a single 'static'
  measurement, currently considered by official guidelines, see
  <A HREF="http://www.well-net.com/cardiov/hahbp.html">www.well-net.com/cardiov/hahbp.html</A>
  or JNC 7's recent <A HREF="http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/42/6/1206/TBL3">reclassification
  of blood pressure for adults</A>, that should and can be replaced
  by a chronomic interpretation, see <A HREF="http://www.phoenix.tc-ieee.org/Phoenix_Bibliography.htm#anchor75992">Why
  7-Day Blood Pressure Monitoring? Healthwatch 3</A>.&quot;</P>
  <P>The image below shows an idealized 7-day profile of systolic
  blood pressure, picturing some of the features found in actual
  data, namely a prominent circadian rhythm with a period of about
  24 hours and higher values during the active span than during
  the rest span, an about 7-day component with higher values during
  mid-week than during the weekend, and an about 1.7-hour component
  related to the REM cycle by night (e.g., from 00:00 to 06:50),
  frequency demultiplied into an about 3.4-hour component by day
  (e.g., from 06:50 to 24:00). The 7-day component is also modulating
  the circadian amplitude, showing larger amplitudes during mid-week
  than during weekends.</P>
  <P>Therefore, it is important to assess the blood pressure variations
  (cycles), not a static value. The concept of the <A HREF="../0001_Bibliography/a-pdf_Story%20Behind%20the%20Chronome_Neuroendocrinology%20Letters%20ISSN%200172-780X.pdf">chronome</A>
  (41 KB pdf) was introduced to enable this. A more detailed presentation
  is given in <A HREF="http://www.phoenix.tc-ieee.org/0001_Bibliography/Chronomics_Biomed%20Pharmacother%202001_%2055_1-39.pdf#page=3">Chronomics</A>
