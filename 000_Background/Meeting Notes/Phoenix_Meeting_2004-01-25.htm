  - Opencores.org<BR>
  - Differences<BR>
  -- General Public License: anyone can use Open Source (OS) products
  if they agree that any improvement is also part of OS. <BR>
  -- OS takes a long time. <BR>
  - Ownership<BR>
  -- Richard Stallman created the General Public License with a
  copyleft which guarantees that anyone can use it for free &amp;
  all improvements must be changed. <BR>
  -- Lesser GPL: if one improves an OS product, it remains OS,
  but they retain proprietary rights to derivative products. <BR>
  -- To place a Patent in public domain, you must assure it doesnt
  infringe on other patents, use: <BR>
  United States Statutory Invention Registration. It's exactly<BR>
  like a patent, except it's only used for defensive purposes.
  If you go to:<BR>
  http://www.uspto.gov/ and search the patent database for number
  'H1444'<BR>
  you'll see an example. <BR>
  -- RAND: Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory <BR>
  Wade suggested a couple of helpful web sites on open IP:<BR>
  The Duke University Center for the Study of the Public Domain
  has some very helpful legal information and links. They are at:
  http://www.law.duke.edu/cspd/ <BR>
  The Open Collector at http://www.opencollector.org/ has some
  very practical information too and may help with IP issues and
  promotion on our Phoenix project.<BR>
  All of the standards organizations (ANSI, IEEE, etc.) have patent
  policies now. They might be helpful because they're all trying
  to eliminate patented inventions from their standards. <BR>
