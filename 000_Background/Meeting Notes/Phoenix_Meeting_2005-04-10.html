<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P><B>Status Review</B></P>

<P><B>* Wade:</B> Added items to the Bibliography page Sahyoun
- Open Source and Fishman's China Inc about how China is using
open source because they do not have a legal concept of intellectual
property. He discussed the Open Source Initiative (OSI) and various
techniques for placing intellectual property in the public domain.</P>

<P><B>* Germaine:</B> reviewed her <A HREF="../../014_Systems_Architecture_and_Engineering/stories/Education-Scenario.pdf">Education
Rehabilitiation scenario</A>. We emailed it to Chris Adams who
will include it in his requirements analysis.</P>

<P><B>* Bob:</B> Asked if cuff calibration should be done on both
arms and if the new techniques are sensitive enough.</P>

<P><B>* Tom Renner, Dave Skramsted &amp; Dan Glumac:</B> Are considering
projects such as the embedded software (local/wearable subsystem),
the optoelectric and piezo film blood flow sensors.</P>

<P><B>* Gerry:</B> Discussed his draft of a patient scenario -
Rehabilitation Primary Care scenario. He will email it to Chris.</P>

<P><B>* Chris:</B> This was a great meeting because we discovered
two new requirements: 1) session to session analysis (a short-term
trend issue) and 2) Long-term trend analysis (a long-term trend
issue).</P>

<P><B>Next Meeting: </B>At our next meeting on 4/24, we are expecting
Ralph Cardinal, Director of Device Engineering at Guidant, to
speak on testing in the design phase. Max Cortner, Director of
Test Engineering at Guidant, who spoke to us on testing in the
manufacturing phase, will accompany him. Specifically, we wanted
to ask them:<BR>
* What does software need to create for the testers, especially
if testing is done before the software exists?<BR>
* What does design phase testing mean? <BR>
* How should software developers approach testing? Do they need
to think in a specific process? Do they need to create a test,
eg. test driven development? <BR>
* What does it mean to the integrity of the test process if testers
are part of the design process? How do they remain separate and
'part of the loyal opposition'?</P>
