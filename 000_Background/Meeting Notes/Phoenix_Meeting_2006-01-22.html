<H3>Discussion</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>Carl Schu joined us.
  <LI>Larry Beatty. Fixed several bugs in the xchron, needs to
  complete testing, and identified more bugs and wants to discuss
  them with Germaine before he determines how to proceed. Germaine
  described that there are 20 clusters of users worldwide, each
  with several hundred individuals. The Sphygmochron is a prototype
  application. Chris Fuller asked if they had HIPAA clearance.
  Germaine said they have HIPAA and other clearances.
  <LI>Gerry presented a clinical information systems minitopic
  the difference between an engineers and a physicians perpspective
  on diagnosis, where the physician uses the SOAP approach: subjective,
  objective, assessment and plan. When a physician iterates, they
  go back to objective, but typically not the subjective step,
  instead referring to another physician if this doesn't work.
  <LI>Chris Schu, John Saywer, Dave Skramstad, and El Nolley will
  participate in a sensor team meeting called by Dave. Dave will
  send out a meeting notices, including the Phoenix email list
  server to include others.
  <LI>Our next meeting will occur on 2/12.
