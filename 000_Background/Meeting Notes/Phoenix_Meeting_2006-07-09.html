<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P><B>Status Review:</B></P>

<P>* Sensor Status from Dave Skramsted: The Sensor Team met last
Sunday morning at the lab. Mary Joe is working on a calibration
method for DPTT, Alex is building a piezo amplifier board, Carl
and I are looking at applying ultrasound technology and have discussed
alternative DPTT methodology. El &amp; Dave are meeting with the
Innovation Study Group next Thursday to recruit sensor engineers
for Phoenix. <BR>
* Project status from Mary Jo: She ordered the software for the
lab's oscilloscope and and is writing a summary of Chen's Patent.<BR>
* Larry: Fixing the bugs in the Sphygmochron prototype. One is
straightforward and the second requires restructuring. He is investigating
open source visual basic test frameworks, but hasn't found one
that works in Excel. He would like from the project: 1) a way
get revision control, e.g. SourceForge, 2) what kind of license.
Chris suggested that we look at the various licenses and make
a suggestion. Larry said that the GPL just discusses libraries.
Chris said we need a written analysis of the licenses we choose
and why we selected them. SourceForge has a selection of 60 licenses
and you must select one. These licenses have been approved by
OpenSource.org .<BR>
* Chris: Working on his paper on low cost open source medical
devices, citing the Phoenix project and ambulatory blood pressure
monitors, on privacy requirements. Major sections will cover scenarios
with communication diagrams including self-care and self-survillanence,
internet care, etc. It will include public health, such as when
will a public health worker hold the ABPM, what are they doing,
and why are they doing it. It is written for the Halberg Chronobiology
Center that will be presented to the Chinese in September and
will be placed in a suitable journal from which the center typically
receives offer for article placements. The second step after the
paper is to present the Data Analysis Methods, which is higher
priority that communities, investigating communication protocols,
specifications for the devices. <BR>
* Bob: Let than one page long Sphygmochron quality system, and
a quality system for the ABPM. <BR>
* Gerry: Continuing to work as a pediatrician, had lunch with
Debra and Vergil Slee, who wrote &quot;The Endangered Medical
Record.&quot; Also, looking at the information that occurs around
the clinical care process, the network of flows. Using the physical
chart as a token of current status deals with which activity/pile
it is, while the digital record can obviate this but these activities'
status must also be maintained. <BR>
* Germaine: reviewed the book by Dr. Kane, and is writing a review.
The book asserts that clinical medicine based on a single value
assessment at a point in time doesn't affectively deal with chronic
illnesses such as asthma, diabetes, and depression. You can't
determine change over time - longitudinal information. You cannot
involve the clinician continuously. You need a process that gathers
this information over time, such as lung function communicated
via telecommunication. Then, you are dealing with issues of privacy,
Creating profiles, looking at change, medications, changing dosages.
Change from acute care to chronic illnesses. Chris: When does
the person on the internet become a care provider as defined by
HIPAA. Germaine says that from the perspective of this book, HIPAA
may be a hindrance. Chris: We need to determine when HIPAA is
involved and not involve. HIPAA is triggered by specific conditions.
For example, if you never submit an electronic insurance claim,
HIPAA is not triggered. With the Phoenix ABPM, the working assumption
is that the data is the patient's. Germaine: A letter from Halberg
Chronobiology Center is being published in the New England Journal
of Medicine.</P>

<P>Bob - Phoenix Sphygmochron Quality System. Bob submitted a
draft quality system on paper, asked that it not be published
to our website for the Sphygmochron and for the Phoenix Ambulatory
Blood Pressure Monitor, and gave a paper copy to Germaine. This
was provided to address possible FDA requirements of Phoenix Project
activities with the Sphymochron program enhancements that will
be used by the Halberg Chronobiology Center with their worldwide
research.</P>
