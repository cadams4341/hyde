Discussion</H3>

<P>Prasanga Lokuge joined the Phoenix Project.</P>

<P>We reviewed the new items on the website, looked at Medwave's
Vasotrax, and asked if it was an ABPM. Germaine says the definition
of an ABPM is: automatic (programmed to take measurements and
needs no action to take the measurements), small enough to carry
with you, takes measurements at intervals, and places values in
memory so they can be retrieved. Also, allows pressing a button
to get a 'manual' messurement.  We should post a definition. 
John suggested we define a set of features. </P>

<P><B>Project Status</B></P>

<P>Wade: 1) He completed his patent disclosure  process to assure
ownership prior to placing it into the public domain. 2) Battery
capabilities are identified on the Power project page.  He has
updated the page. We noted that the rechargable battery has smaller
current for the service cycle, so we may need more cells that
stated over the service life.  3) Conductive technologies sent
him electrodes. </P>

<P>Wayne: Looked at the requirements of an oscillator. He asked,
&quot;What's a good mic for listening to the heart? Some cost
$270.&quot;  Bob suggested that he go to Knolles, an electronics
company that makes mics for hearing aids. Reed Killin, who worked
for Knolles and now has an electronics company, would be a good
source of information.  <BR>
Germaine: 1) Sent a pdf from Braun, that used used arterial size
as an input to blood pressure, and arm rotation. 2) submitted
a paper was accepted., 3) Bakken museum has lots of volunteers
who want hands on experience.  </P>

<P>John Gould: Get the components for the accelerometers.  Bob
asked, &quot;What is the sensitivity of the accelerometer? John
said the range will be no greater than +/- 1 G.  </P>

<P>Group: To design the local systems software, we could create
a conceptual reference data.  We could define a reference data
file that the software would process.  We could define the device
protocol and a BIOS for the system software and the application
software. </P>

<P><BR>
Our next meeting will occur on January 9th and we'll continue
meeting on the 2nd and 4th Sunday of every month.</P>
