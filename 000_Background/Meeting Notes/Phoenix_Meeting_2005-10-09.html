<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>Michael Balow of Freescale joined us.  Larry looking for software
that can emulate a microprocessor or micro-controller, for test
driven design and automated testing.  Mike said he can provide
it, any of 8 bit, 16 bit, or 32 bit processors. Also, he can provide
emulators. </P>

<P>Dave Skramstad has built a piezo film blood pressure sensor,
Dan Glumac and Mary Jo Rawson are building another two.  Now,
he is looking at using Labview to measure the time using cross
correlation techniques where Labview is a virtual instrument for
realtime digital signal processing.  John suggested going to National
Instrument's website and seeing their online tutorials and manual.
 John Gould suggested several contacts for people who are knowledgeable
of Labview.  By next meeting he hopes to investigate Labview.</P>

<P>Gerry is working on the minitopics on Clinical information
systems. El will send the open source copyright text to use on
his presentations so that they can be posted on the Phoenix website.</P>

<P>John has been working with Mike on the 3-D Star accelerometer.
 Then, he will have a board for testing. He is changing the software.
He wants to work with Gerrmaine to determine sampling rates, output
information, and perhaps activity, and especially wants to determine
the precision needed. </P>

<P>Chris Adams led us in a requirements discussion.  He talked
about the subsystem requirements, especially the Diary Subsystem.
 His has a question for Gerry: we envision two software packages:
1) physiologists work on who populations with all data ever collected,
exporting data that meet profiles structured by subject (e.g.
patients, healthy subjects) characteristics.  2) Do clinical care
support systems span patient support and decision support?  Gerry
says it is a decision support system for physicians caring for
patients, so that they can identify the characteristics, with
different modes, eg. population characteristics, compared with
individual patients that help0 the clinicial and patient make
a good decision in real time.  We may have overlap of some functions
across the interface between the Phoenix monitor and the clinical
care support system. </P>

<P>We discussed the functions of signal, amplifier, A/D, analysis
(e.g. labview), perhaps the interface between the local and remote
subsystems are the A/D vs Analysis.</P>

<P>The data might look like:<BR>
T, A1, A2, x, y, z,<BR>
and then repeat,<BR>
where T is time, A1, A2 are amplitudes,  and<BR>
x,y,z are the 3 d accelerometers coordinates.</P>

<P>Gerry presented on Clinical Information Systems, &quot;How
is it Different?&quot;  1) Mobile workflow, 2) patient centered,
3) clinician-centered.  </P>

<P>Traditional business workflow is often stationary, while clinician
workflow is mobile.  For example, there is no time to login. 
</P>

<P>Clinician workflow is mobile: local mobility: moving form room
to room, patient to patient.  Extended Mobility: physicians move
from clinic to hospital and back. </P>

<P>Interacting with an informaion fountain: clinicians interact
with a clinical computer like people interact with a drinking
fountain: Walk up, Drink Briefly, and Leave. </P>

<P>Physicians were early adopters of telephones, they aren't adopting
computers because it doesn't fit the workflow. </P>

<P>Patient-Centered Clinical Workflow:<BR>
* Schedule appointments<BR>
  - leave time for Same-Day Urgent visits.<BR>
* Appointment Reminder<BR>
* Check-in<BR>
* Pre-Process<BR>
  - Weight &amp; Height, Vital Signs, ROS (review of systems),
UA (urine analysis &amp; routine bloodwork), rooming<BR>
* Clinician Encounter<BR>
* Post-Process<BR>
  - Lab, X-rayl, Shots, Handouts, Re-Rooming &amp; Re-Encounter<BR>
* Check-out<BR>
* In-Practice flow-up scheduling: appointments &amp; phone calls.<BR>
* Outside referral and prescriptions.</P>

<P>Opportunities for change are integrating: medical records,
patient historyy, lab results..</P>

<P>Clinician-Centered Workflow:<BR>
* Today's clnic patients<BR>
- Morning /afternoon/Evening ..<BR>
- Avoid clusters of complicated patients who will likely need
more than average time: multiple chronic illneses, need interpreter,
...<BR>
* Curent Hospital Patients, by hospital and unit<BR>
* Recent Patients, <BR>
  - Pending dictation and to do<BR>
  - Pending Resutls aned consults<BR>
* Curent Results<BR>
 - by urgency<BR>
 - by patient</P>

<P>Work Smarter, Not Harder<BR>
* Learn from Experience<BR>
- Which clinicans work here<BR>
- Which inrformation is most used<BR>
* Pre-Fetch Information for each clinician<BR>
- Patients of Interest: <BR>
- Results of Interest. <BR>
* Track Patients Status while in Clinic <BR>
- Coordinate among physician and other staff<BR>
* Coordinate Flow-up<BR>
- In practice flow-up<BR>
- External Referrals and Prescriptions</P>

<P>Issue: <BR>
- Doing what hasn't been able to do well before: tracking results
&amp; referrals coming back to the clinician, like lab results.
 It never gets back to the physician in time to be useful unless
the patient carries it. </P>
