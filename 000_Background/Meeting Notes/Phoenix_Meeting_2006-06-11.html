<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P><B>Status Review:</B></P>

<P>* Alex joined us as a recent graduate of the UofM with a specialty
in signal processing and firmware. </P>

<P>* Germaine: Started checking the new versions of the Sphygmochron.
 The new features, some of the numbers are not right and still
get error message.  Chris sent a question on public health usage
scenarios.  Franz and Germaine produced an abstract for Chris
to review.  After Chris adds his comments, it will be posted.
 So, she has open activities with Larry and Chris. </P>

<P>* Mary Jo: Running into constraints with the lab. Got a new
oscilloscope, fried her board, the voltage generator doesn't produce
a low enough signal to test, went online to determine how, Agilent
Model DSO 3062A, S/N CN4503894, Software version is 3.01.28, and
a firmware update USB A to B.  </P>

<P>* Bob Schlentz: Omron makes home blood pressure monitors. 
Earlier this year, one of the journals had an author who took
apart one of the Omron home monitors and discovered: 1) Cost at
Walgreens was about $40, 2) it didn't do many of the functions
we are addressing, 3) the one-at-at time costs were: $20 for motor,
valves, tubing and cuff), the electronics was around $20.  The
cuff tubing plugs directly into the board, the chamber changes
capacitance with the pressure.  The chamber provides a capacitance
for a ring oscillator to a sine wave, and the processor counts
the pulses per second, and that gets around the need for an analog
to digital converter.  This leads to: it doesn't do what is needed
for this project. If we use something other than a blood pressure
cuff we would need another input.  I thought we would need an
8 bit A-D converter.  Actually, we need a 1000 bits because we
need calibration from FDA and a resolution of 1 mm of mercury
pressure.  If we use something else, we need the same equipment
resolution, range of 0 to 300 mm of mercury.  Going further, with
a typical transducer we can count on a 5% of full-scale variation
for the complete range off the device.  Now, when we look at the
DC output of the piezo system as opposed to the AC, we would have
a steady pressure with one value for the piezo resistor and another
value when it was very low.  When we look at the values from a
changing value, we get the results that were published on the
web (under piezo film sensor). So, we need more resolution.  For
a sensor that we put it on the body, we now have a new FDA requirement.
For the duration of time, it should have no irritation with the
skin.  Notice that the cuffs are usually used with a cover, which
must be compatible with the skin. </P>

<P>Issues:</P>

<P>* Bob: Noticed: 1) HIPAA law suites over insurance firms getting
too much information from clinicians.  2) RoHS - without lead
in solder, you get inter-metallic growths that produce junctions
between the two copper surfaces breaking the connection, and this
can occur in 120 days, even just sitting on a shelf.  Even silver
solder has tin, lead and silver. </P>
