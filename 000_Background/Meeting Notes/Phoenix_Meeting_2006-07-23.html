<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P><B>Status Review:</B></P>

<P>* Dave Skramsted: The Sensor Team met Sunday, 7/16. Jack Gordon
joined the group. He's looking into free online collaboration
tools. So far, we've been exchanging papers and ideas via email
(we need a forum where we can exchange document files). Alex completed
building and testing a piezo board. John Gould described and showed
us his Freescale motion sensor assembly. Looking ahead, we discussed
lab tools; the consensus is we'll need something like Labview
and an associated PC interface to sufficiently demonstrate the
capability of a working prototype sensor subsystem. Also, I suggested
something like the Finapres Ohmeda 2300 finger sensor as a reference
system for correlation - the team agreed it would be very useful.
Don't know yet where we might obtain or borrow such a system;
perhaps Franz or Germaine might have some ideas (these are future
needs).</P>

<P>In the meantime Carl, Alex, Mary Jo and I are meeting this
Sunday at 1:00 PM in the lab. We are going to power up the piezo
system and do some experimentation. For one thing, we are going
to look more closely at the &quot;secondary pulse&quot; which
appears at the radial artery. Carl is wondering whether it might
be a venous return; it's just an idea at this point, but if it
is venous return, it could potentially allow us to measure pulse
transit time with a single piezo film sensor.</P>

<P>We need a forum where we can exchange document files. We are
considering Schtuff' (http://www.schtuff.com/), for which we could
include a link on the Phoenix Sensor Team page. It's simple, easy
to use, has access control features and allows 200MB of free storage.
I really like the design and simplicity of Schtuff. Wikispaces
is also good (they offer 2GB of storage). Jack Gordon has offered
to investigate alternatives - we'll see what he comes up with.</P>

<P>* Chris: Continuing on privacy requirements paper, needs scenario
diagrams, we need pictures showing the people involved, systems
involved, the major data that moves between the systems, the barriers.
It is very much like an object communications diagram. The title
of the paper is &quot;Privacy Requirements for low price chronomedical
devices&quot;</P>

<P>* Mary Jo: At the lab we are getting sufficiently strong signals,
and we are capturing them. We are calibrating them to Chen's A
and B parameters by using Germaine's ABPM. We are developing a
Matlab program to cross correlate to find the time difference.</P>

<P>* Alex: we have the software running to transfer data from
the oscilloscope to computer. We are using Matlab for time series
analysis. We are working through the problems associated with
getting consistent measurements, such as tape adhesive. Bob suggested
using rubber tubing, commonly called the Penrose Drain. Get them
at University Supply store, or look in the Fischer catalog. Alex
noted that it would be very interesting to hear from a person
who works with patents and can tell us how not violate the patent.
Bob suggested that Jim Holte has a book in his library by Petersen
that is relevant.</P>

<P>* John: Completed his remote assignment for his employer, retunred
to the Twin Cities and is contacting Mike Balow from Free Scale
to resume software development of the motion sensor.</P>

<P>* El: Larry completed changes to the Sphygmochron program that
Germaine requested and sent it to her. Norm Bayne, who has been
working on SOPs for our quality system, has moved to Michigan
to accept a position as a veterinarian and is leaving the project.</P>

<P>* Gerrmaine: Received new version of the program from Larry
on a spreadsheet.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Topic: Phoenix Sphymochron Quality System.</B></P>

<P>Bob summarized a proposed quality system for the prototype
sphygmochron, a program that analyzes the data provided by the
ABPMs currently used by the Halberg Chronobiology Center. They
have gotten approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB),
with two principal investigators, Franz and Germaine. Their relationship
is between Franz and Germaine, the people they are working with,
and the IRB. They must apply to monitor up to a specific number
of people each year. If you exceed this number you must get a
new process or update the process. Each time they have to provide
a device, they need a consent form from the researchers with signatures
of Franz and Germain, and a HIPAA document. The ABPM is FDA approved.
The program is under the research project and needs no FDA approval.
No change to drug or dosage is made, merely a change in timing
of dosage. There is no regulation for timing of dosage. <BR>
Chris noted that in clinical studies there is an IRB, the device
is under an FDA regulatory process. What if a medical device firm
agreed to provide assistance to the Halberg Chronology Center
to improve their program, does that require an FDA regulatory
process? If Germaine has a graduate student improve the program,
it does not need FDA approval. If diagnoses are made with the
program, does it need regulatory approval? If diagnoses are not
used, then it doesn't need approval. <BR>
