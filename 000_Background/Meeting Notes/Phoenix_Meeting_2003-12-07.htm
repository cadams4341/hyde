  Monitor Project<BR>
  <U>12/07/2003 Meeting Notes</U></FONT></CENTER></H2>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Attendees: Bob Schlentz, El Nolley, Franz Halberg, Othild
  Schwartzkopff, Germaine Cornelissen-Guillaume, Uri Spector <BR>
<BR>
  Franz: This is more than a cost problem, it is an educational
  problem, so involve schools, measure blood pressure of school
  children. <BR>
<BR>
  Bob showed a batteryless flashlight with a capacitor that was
  charged by shaking it. A similar technique could be used to power
  an automeasuring process, using normal body motion. <BR>
<BR>
  Needs: Results should be comparable regardless of changes ia
  algorithm, <BR>
<BR>
  Questions: <BR>
  *Is too low blood pressure -.hypotension - important? Yes, among
  the elderly, diabetics and others. <BR>
  * Does determining drug timing require a different study for
  each drug? Yes, different for each drug and each person.<BR>
  * Is it needed to monitor regardless of activity? No, it is acceptable
  for them to &quot;freeze&quot;. <BR>
  * What price threshold below which the physician would use it
  for routine physical exams? The typical general physician would
  never use the blood pressure monitor without being required.
<BR>
<BR>
  Objective: a device that collects continuous or periodic blood
  pressure, is user friendly, easily retrievable, useful in treatment.<BR>
