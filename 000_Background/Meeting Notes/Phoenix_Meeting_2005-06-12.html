<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>Richie and Ryan Huynh are juniors at Champlain High School.
They won the 4th prize in the International Science Fair for their
study of variations in blood pressure with ambulatory blood pressure
monitors. Specifically, they examined how exercise affects blood
pressure. Their hypothesis was that it was time of day dependent.
They investigated the effect of ethnicity, academic orientattion,
stress, age, gender, and athletic orientation. The exercises included
jump rope, pushups and curl ups. Click <A HREF="../../0001_Bibliography/20050621huyn_Richie%20and%20Ryan%20Huynh%20summary.pdf">here</A>
for a summary of their study.</P>

<P>Ryan and Richie asked us to describe the Phoenix project. Chris
described it and showed him the Phoenix Ambulatory Blood Pressure
System, specifically the <A HREF="../../014_Systems_Architecture_and_Engineering/images/system-block-diagram.jpg">system
block diagram</A> and noted that the keys that will distinguish
Phoenix are the sensors and the integration with the diary.</P>

<P>We were interested in the diary process. When they removed
the APBMs for bathing, they recharged the ABPM, and this took
an hour.</P>

<P>From a logistics perspective over the five week study, others
became annoyed at the alarm, especially their classroom teachers.
Participants had problems dealing with rashes. One subject's father
made him stop. Participants had to deal with the alarms and ABPM
measurements waking them at night. Though many more students were
interested, they selected their participants so that they had
the same sleep and wake cycle. Out of 14 participants, 3 or 4
had rashes, but all them felt itchy. Many participants felt that
it was annoying to carry the ABPMs. They took manual reading before
and after exercise.</P>

<P>They noted the time they woke, when they went to sleep, had
meals, medications, exercises, and abnormal stress. All students
took the same classes, so they knew what they were doing and when.
At the begining, they were given a letter explaining the process,
another letter telling them how to do it, and another letter to
maintain it.</P>

<P>One participant had an equipment mailfunction, lost a week
of data. Then, another's machine had too much data and suffered
a data storage malfunction. Another subject had to drop out because
of a rash, so they substituted the working machine for the malfuncted
machine. They used Halberg Chronobiology Center's analysis sofware.
The previously used ABPM enabled diary codes, but this system
did not.</P>

<P>Initially, the subjects were excited, but after one week some
were less enthusiastic. During weeks 2-4, some participants had
rashes. By the week 5, the last week, the participants became
excited again. Richie and Ryan gave them prizes for completion
of milestones. One participant with sustained abnormal CHAT was
taking medications throughout the study.</P>

<P>The diary included the exercise values, like number of jump
robes, push ups, curl ups, and their times.</P>

<P>They concluded that a diary was too much to expect their particpants
to create. They should all have similar week schedule and sleep
cycles, then they only had to record when necessary, so that abmormal
activities were minimal and only those were recorded.</P>

<P>Germaine noted that occaisonally blood pressure is highly correlated
with meals.</P>

<P>Chris: The software team is picking a direction and priority.
There are two areas to put effort, 1) OS in the device itself,
2) the physiologist workstation. The clinical and self help areas
are iomportant, but we don't are not likely to make progress there
at this time.</P>

<P>Dave: The sensor team has met several times. Dave is building
a piezo film sensor and amplifier.</P>

<P>Chris: We need to have a collaborative infrastructure. Dennis
suggested a Wiki we can deploy.</P>

<P>Our next meeting will occur on June 26.<BR>
