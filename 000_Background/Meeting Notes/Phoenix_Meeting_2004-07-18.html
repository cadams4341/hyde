<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>El is leading the Regulatory project and was asked to post
his preliminary Quality System Requirements (QSR) notes.<BR>
Wade discussed progress with the Impedance Plethysmograph project.
He noted that patents could be posted to a webpage, and would
tell us how to do that so that 1) the links remain active, and
2) the images are included. These existing technologies are important
because they highlight techniques we can use now and can apply
in different contexts without infringing on the patent. We can
easily modify many of them to not infringe on their patent or
if necessary, or ask the owner for permission to use their patent
or buy the patent, and often they will sell it to you for $1 because
it is for a good cause and they get the great publicity for it.
Wade wants feedback on this subproject.</P>

<P>Bob says that IEEE Explore has engineering in biology and medicine
transactions back to 1968. We can check into how to get digital
access to IEEE journals, and other journals, and ultimately post
this information on our website.</P>

<P>Germaine showed us information that is published to the Halberg
Site under published journals and &quot;blood pressure&quot;.</P>

<P>Wade asked about accuracy and if we need a real-time clock.
Germaine said within a minute over a week should be sufficient.
John asked whether beat to beat measurements are important, Germaine
said yes, but it is a question of what can be afforded.</P>

<P>Wade noted that Arden if would look through the patents around
the real-time clock as a way to begin the microprocessor project.
John will look at the 3 axis accelerometerget data on what is
typical and possible and make it inexpensive. John noted that
measuring blood pressure on the forearm is easy because it can
get close to an artery, but on the upper arm there is so much
tissue that it is hard to get close to a major vessel.</P>

<P>Bob said it is important to assure that the contact with the
body doesn't cause skin problems, so placing it over cloth or
clothing might be useful, and sports athletes have to deal with
this, especially runners. Some people want to displays and want
others to see that they have it as &quot;one upmanship&quot;.</P>

<P>We looked at the product literature on Medwave's ABPM - Vasotrac
and Vasotrax. <BR>
<BR>
Germaine mentioned that she knows Lipicky who worked for the FDA
on ABPM. He was interested in long term blood pressure changes
and the opportunity to impact FDA regulations to emphasize longer
term measurements;<BR>
<BR>
We discussed digital access to journals. We need a list of digitally
accessible journals and will consider items other than academic
journals, such as Sports Illustrated, The New Scientist, Scientific
American, Science News, trade magazines, Medical Device Instrumentation,
Medical Electronics, Medical Manufacturing and blogs. When our
members have it and notice that it has general use, send the journal
and URL to El to post on the bibliography.<BR>
