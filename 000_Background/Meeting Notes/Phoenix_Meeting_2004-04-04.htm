  <P><B>Discussion</B></P>
  <P>Reviewed the Website and email list server</P>
  <P>Wade reviewed his prototype monitor using a peizo film sensor
  using the postings from website . He showed his prototype, showed
  the data, and showed that from the data we could measure heartbeat,
  blood velocity and blood pressure. With a modification using
  piezo cable with embedded weights, it could provide motion of
  the body.</P>
  <P>Wade will experiment more, with more sensors, with piezo cable,
  different orientations.</P>
  <P>We discussed fund raising to help support activities like
  building prototypes. Get corporate sponsors.</P>
  <P>Next meeting 4/18, then 5/2</P>
