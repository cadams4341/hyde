<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>Germaine noted that methods like the cosinor are commonly presented
as methods of acceptability without crossing the line into diagnosis.</P>

<P>Franz discussed cyclic phenomena like blood pressure that have
daily, weekly, transyear (1.3 years). There may be links to physical
cycles like solar wind cycles that have 1.3 yr cycles, earth magnetic
field cycles. 53 years ago, people did not accept circadian rhythms.
Spacelab is considering an instrument that has blood pressure
and activity.</P>

<P>Dan helped Dave Skramsted on his board development.</P>

<P>John Gould reviewed a 3D accelerometer from FreeScale, build
cost might be around $6, price is $50 from Freescale. Can take
200 samples per sec.</P>

<P>Venkat: evaluating RT Linux. 8-12 usec cycle, as an open source
Linux, measurement on 486. Can reduced latency by: faster processor,
strip out modules, supervisory mode. 10-15 usec. We need read
data every msec. Easy to do, 4 sensors.</P>

<P>Bob Schlentz: tried ambulatory blood pressure monitors, couldn't
find a way to carry it because he is big, made a little pouch
to carry it, as neurostimulators were carried 30 years ago. Jim
Holte said that when we are ready to try it, we should visit Dr.
Dengle in kinesthesiology. His lab has been available for human
physiology for Jim. Eg. treadmill. We can perform our system tests
in his lab.</P>

<P>Dave Skramsted: worked with Dan to reproduce Wade's prototype,
3 pole active low pass filter, DC gain of 30 dB, cutoff frequency
is 10 Hz, filter out line noise. Got one board running, another
is close. Then, we'll configure with different piezo sensors.
Mary Jo Rawson indicated that she'll do her senior class project
with the Phoenix project. Dave injected 10 mvolt, 5 Hz sine wave
and observed an amplified version on the board. This is for a
piezo film sensors. Need more regulators, got 3, broke two. Need
more sensors, he ordered them and expects to have them working
within a month. Cost Estimates: another $25, need $100 + $100
(paid by Dave), + $20 (soldiering iron): $245 total. He'll tell
us the actual value in two weeks. We'll need a budget for 2006.</P>

<P>Venkat said he would be interested in working on the processor
component of the local subsystem.</P>

<P>Next meeting date would be 8/28, but the IEEE section has its
Summer Soire picnic then. So our next meeting will occur on 9/11.
Chris will be vacationing and doesn't want to miss Germaine's
presentation, so he would like Germaine's presentation to resume
on 9/26.</P>
