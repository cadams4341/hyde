<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>Gerry Werth, Clinician Computing.EE, MD, PhD. Gerry presented
on clinical information systems.</P>

<P>- Outline: engineering, primer, mass customizaiton, clinician
computing, Information technologyg, Free or Open Source SW.</P>

<P>- Engineering Challenge: Healthcare is the most complex domain
to model in software. Doctors think differently.</P>

<P>- Economic Stakeholders<BR>
-- vendors<BR>
-- customers (decisions)<BR>
-- consumers (quality)<BR>
-- wallets (money)</P>

<P>- Primary stakeholders<BR>
-- customer (clinician)<BR>
-- consumers (patient)<BR>
-- wallets (purchaser, insurance firms)</P>

<P>- Historically, the role of the healer was to 'name' the illness,
so that they had power over it.</P>

<P>- &quot;One reason it is so complex, is the customerr, consumer
and wallets have no interests in common.&quot; Bob Lewis, InfoWorld,
2002.</P>

<P>* Mass customization.<BR>
-- Traditional model: invention - craft shop<BR>
-- Industrial model: Factory - mass production<BR>
-- Information model:</P>

<P>* Three organizations:<BR>
-- Hospital: has been a team, is trying to become a factory. <BR>
-- University: specialists are at the bottom. <BR>
-- Symphony: conductory coordinates specialists in a team-flat
organization.</P>

<P>- Healthcare information systems should change towards mass
customization via the network model.</P>

<P>* Chris Fuller, Open Source Medical Expert System.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>- Current systems are inaccurate, unreliable.<BR>
- Problem: physicians are overwhelmed.<BR>
-- Costs are increasing.<BR>
-- Error rates in US are high<BR>
-- some people in 3rd world will never see a physician.</P>

<P>* Existing Medical DSS (Decision Support System) / Expert Systems<BR>
- 70 known systems<BR>
- most are proprietary.<BR>
* Proposed Solution<BR>
- Open Source DSS/Expert system.<BR>
-- more physician quaity time<BR>
-- improved care and accourace.<BR>
- allows verificaitni.<BR>
-- allows update<BR>
-- integration with CIS/EMR <BR>
-- reduction in overall cost per person-hour.</P>

<P>- Examples: <BR>
-- EADSS - EMR - USER</P>

<P>- Standards<BR>
-- ASTM E31.28, HLL7 <BR>
-- ANSI grant to harmonize these standards, possible completion
in 1-2 yrs.</P>

<P>- Features of Openm Source DSS/Expert Systems<BR>
-- ARDEN standardized syntax.</P>

<P>-- Ease interface with Clinicall Information Systems CIS, Electronic
Heallth Record EHR, Hospital Information Systems HIS</P>

<P>- Simplified Graphjica;;l User Interface.</P>

<P>- Issues<BR>
-- Privacy (no code sharing)<BR>
--- viruses with mobile code<BR>
--- HIPPA<BR>
-- Clinical Trial Hurdles: <BR>
--- make recommendations, not diagnoses.</P>

<P>- Next Steps<BR>
-- Setup up IEEEE study group for open source CIS &amp; DSS</P>
