<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>Our next meeting will occur on November 21.  </P>

<P>Under software requirements, Chris noted that for interative/prototype
development, we need three items: software needs, architecture,
and an implementation.  He also suggested that the software architecture
should include a reference data maintenance subsystem.  </P>

<P><U>Bob/Cuff Calibration</U>: We continued with Bob's questions:
* battery, * user, * other measurements, * sphygmomanometer manufacturers,
* power, and * packaging.   </P>

<P>Bob noted that needs of different customers will differ in
different geographic regions.  For example, you buy a battery
in US, but in South America and Africa often you cannot buy a
battery.  Therefore, in the US and Europe our battery-based ABPM
test may be appropriate (or wherever else batteries are easily
accessible), but in other areas, we should define a more appropriate
power source.  Similarly, it is useful to have a circuit board
power requirement that is not 3 times 1.5 volts (3 cells) but
is zero times 1.5 volts, e.g. no batteries.  Weight is critical.
 In implantable medical devices, they fight for fractions of a
gram and advertise it when it is achieved.  However, this product
will not be implanted.  We don't want it to be heavier than a
wrist watch.  As heavy as a band aid  would be ideal.  The processing
power should be dedicated to calculating just the data and we
shouldn't do anything we don't need to do.  Regarding communications,
we've looked at USB, Serial, and Ethernet.  Everything seems to
take 30 mA, except for flash memory, which takes almost nothing.
We need raw data for every heart beat, 4 channels for 2 sensors
and accelerometer, and temperature and time stamp.  We could use
an 8050 processor to get raw data wave form for every heart beat,
save it and then determine how to process it into heart beat,
blood pressure, blood flow, 3-D acceleration and a time stamp.
 </P>

<P>Bob provided us with a copy of  ANSI/AAMI SP10-1992 and we
reviewed it.  He noted that page 20, Figure B.1 of standard shows
phases 1-5, phase 5 is silent and less than 1% of Phase 1.  Page
37 shows greater error during exercise. </P>

<P>Bob will provide us with the patent numbers for electrodes
that don't touch the skin.  During the next meeting we'll discuss:
* Sphygmomanometers, * Other measurement, and * packaging (e.g.
The ElectroPlaster Company in the UK that has body mounted electronics
to measure muscle signals, electromyograms).</P>

<P><U>Germaine/Data Analysis Methods</U>: Germaine said she knows
of no ABPMs that are compatible with exercise. Colin had one system
that it isn't an ABPM, but was part of a stationery exercise bicycle
that is part of a physiometry station. She hopes to provide a
PowerPoint document of analysis methods for our next meeting.
 She met with Chris.  She is preparing a presentation for a conference
in Taiwan on cartiology at which they will present at two sessions
on Chronobiology. Representatitives from different pharmaceutical
companies will be present. </P>

<P><U>Wade/ Impedance Plethysmograph</U>:  Wade is reviewing how
to use Invention Registration Disclosure and the Manual Patent
Examining Procedure (MEPE).  Currently, he is working on another
invention and is using &quot;Patent It Yourself&quot; by Pressman,
edition 10.  He is going through all of the steps to put an invention
into the public domain, and will provide guidance on how to update
our Phoenix invention process.</P>

<P>Wade showed us a webpage summarizing his review of 21CFR Part11
from www.21cfrpart.com and noted that it specified requirements
for transferring information from uncontrolled documents into
a legal controlled document.  We will post it and reference it
from our Bibliography page. </P>

<P>Summary of our project goals by next meeting on 11/7:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Germaine expects to have a document of her analysis methods
  posted/post-able on the website and a webpage/PDF of her Chronotheranostics
  article.
  <LI>John expects to have information to discuss about his motion
  sensor project.
  <LI>Bob will: provide patent file number for contact-less electrodes.
</UL>

<P>During our next meeting we will discuss: Bob's remaining questions:
* battery, * user, * other measurements, * sphygmomanometer manufacturers,
* power, * packaging. Our working activity will be software requirements.</P>
