<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>Wayne Hochrein joined the Phoenix Project.</P>

<P><B>Project Status</B></P>

<P><U>Wade-Impedance Plethysmograph</U>: Wade showed the most
recent information he has added to his 21CFR page, and HIPPA information
from HHS. He showed us a non-invasive blood pressure monitor for
surgery applications of the T-Line product from Tensys Medical,
Inc. www.tensysmedical.com/t-line_solutions.htm , steps 1-4, using
sonic sensors. Playlists 1-4. Realtime blood pressure management.</P>

<P>He showed his progress with the Impedance Plethysmograph, he
will redesign the amplifier, document Disclosure with the US Patent
and Trademark office for $10, which he will place in the public
domain. This makes a legal document. It becomes a file wrapper,
and you can append it each time for $10.</P>

<P><U>Germaine-Data Analysis Methods</U>: Germaine is working
on the Powerpoint document showing how to analyze blood pressure
data. She is presenting in Taiwan next week and wanted to know
whast we want from the audience of clinicians. Bob suggested that
we wanted to know protocols for testing blood pressure monitors.</P>

<P><U>John-Motion Sensor</U>: John Gould is investigating inexpensive
multichannel accelerometers for the motion sensor. He wanted to
know if we wanted to include a microprocessor, Wade suggested
that we wanted it to be as inexpensive as possible, perhaps as
simple as an 8051 and a watch crystal, less stringent power requirements
for the sensor, more stringent power requirements for the microprocessor.
Perhaps, we'll want a real-time kernel, but we are not sure if
real-time Linux will be sufficient because it may be too big.
driving memory requirements and thus power requirements.</P>

<P><U>El-Manufacturers</U>: Presented a webpage showing blood
pressure monitor <A HREF="../../Phoenix_MfgList.htm">manufacturers</A>.</P>

<P><B>Data Analysis Software Requirements</B></P>

<P>Chris led our discussion of the software architecture issues.
We must identify the needs for application software subsystem.
He noted that we need a external Diary. We identifying the &quot;actors&quot;
and the results were captured on his <A HREF="../../013_Data%20Analysis%20Software/use_cases.htm">project
webpage</A>. <BR>
