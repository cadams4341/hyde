  Wade Peterson<BR>
  Two approaches, pressure cuff &amp; blood velocimeter. <BR>
  Cited Blood Pressure Measurement, from 1999 CRC Press, LLC <BR>
  Auscultatory: blood pressure cuff, increases blood pressure,
  reduces pressure until some blood gets through (systolic pressure),
  then reduce until the sound ceases (diastolic pressure). From
  artery partially open to completely open, highest pressure to
  lowest pressure. <BR>
  Oscillometric Method:</P>
  <P>So, Wade has been looking at low power approaches. Piezo-electric
  film: 90 volts &amp; very low current. Piezofoil from Amp/MSI.
  Navy uses for passive sonor, piezo-cable typically used for high
  frequency 10's of kHz, but what about low frequency. So he designed
  a low pass filter. 1 - 12 Hz. Bob Schlentz says that for long
  time period, 1/10 Hz. The circuit will use a 10 Ohm , 33 dB at
  the 50 Hz point. TLB 2244 at $1.46 in quad pack. Want low current
  amps at low voltages. If under 14 mA, can use AA batteries. Maybe
  200 uA total. Through Express PCB, about $50 to produce the board.
  To put in into the Public Domain, uses Richard Stallman's Copyleft,
  it allows anyone to use or disseminate it as long as they retain
  it, &quot;Copy and Distribution is preserved in any medium, as
  long as the Copyleft statement is preserved.&quot; The copyright
  is an expression of an idea, does not protect the underlying
  design. To protect the design, use a patent. To place the patent
  in the public domain, either give it away or use a Patent Invention
  and place it in the public domain.</P>
  <P>Using a DSP uses a lot of power and decreases battery life.
  Alternatively, just collect data and post-process.</P>
  <P>Wade suggests that we make a prototype, get two boards built,
  about $60 per board, total ~$120,</P>
  <P>Bob suggests using A/D to flash memory, USB/RS422 to main
  instrument, which accepts , parses the data packet of date,name,
  time, info transferred into people readable information at frequent
  intervals (1/sec), into a memory in main instrument, process
  data and show an envelop of the peak of pressure and minimum
  for the time, process the envelop and produce the CHAD for use
  by the Chronobiology lab. Then, we need to calibrate, measure
  actual blood pressure vs our measurement. If the sensor were
  oscillometric, must have that sort of measurement, the cuff measurement
  and our distal peripheral measurement, a display/report that
  determines the match to the cuff measurement, and repeat the
  calibration points frequently to show that the ambulatory instrument
  hasn't been damaged or wanders. Now, can we get any new information
  that would be useful for Chronobiology.</P>
  <P>Wade says Compact Flash Card typically uses 300 mA, $20-$30
  each. USB ~ $20. Ethernet ~ $30. Alternatively, just remove the
  card and transfer it to the collector unit. However, using the
  card pushes price so high it can't be exchanged for &quot;a bushel
  of yams.&quot;</P>
  <P>Bob suggests that we collect raw data and process it to blood
  pressure measurements in central non-worn unit.</P>
  <P>Wade has reviewed Pulse Velocity patents and simulated them
  to determine their components. Found that they are putting a
  DC current and reading . Wade has drafted two project proposals.
  Piezo-film sensor - a blood flow sensor with deliverables: evaluate
  the completed sensor with Public Invention Release and written
  report. Second is Pulse deliverables, IR parts, layout, BOM,
  evaluated completed sensor, PIR, and written report. Another
  project: movement sensor: only take measurements when the body
  is steady. Bob suggests that 2 people per project, total of 13
  people.</P>
  <P>Bob suggests that when we use any polyester film (piezo-electric
  films are such), what are the guidelines in using them on people.</P>
  <P>Get a website. Have it globally available. Wade will start,
  El will get an IEEE website for the Phoenix group.</P>
  <P>Diabetes, 0.01 mm per mm rise in blood pressure, small but
  useful for a blood pressure gain measurement for capacitance,
  and gain afterwards. Eg. the arterial wall is a dialectric material.
  How big a signal, how much motion, for blood pressure &amp; vessel
  measurement</P>
  <P>Another measurement: How to measure the relative position
  of the senor wrt to the top of the heart. Perhaps use a distance
  transducer.</P>
  <P>Another idea: How to make blood flow measurements using the
  time to measure the wave passage. Then, measure the forward and
  backward/retrograde wave,</P>
  <P>Bob: Would like to have this project done in 6 weeks.</P>
  <P>Wade: will start the website and begin the design of the board.
  Will send El the projects. We need a project list &amp; a bibliography,
  a hit counter.</P>
  <P>El: get a website<BR>
  Bob: Present his results<BR>
  Next meeting 3/21 2:30p,<BR>
