  <P>Germaine Cornellsen - Methods</P>
  <P>Vectors, how data will flow, what will be remembered, decisions
  made, then the code can be written.<BR>
  Trying to assess rhythms, predictable values, esp. circadian
  rhythms - 24 hrs, others are &frac12; hr rhythms, Circadian is
  no simple sine but has harmonics, other variations around the
  months and years. For an immediate diagnosis and treatment, circadian
  is most useful because of the daily schedule, taking medications
  in morning, afternoon, evening, bedtime.</P>
  <P>Different kinds of monitors, automonitors have collected data
  every 15 min or 30 min, times of data were determined by light
  or buzzer, but whenever there was a disruption, the process would
  begin again, at the regular interval, but now not equidistant
  from the previous data and not comparable. The newer monitors
  are 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes, and when there is an interruption,
  there is just missing values. Germaine's process is least squares
  so it isn't as susceptible to such problems, but it requires
  sufficient data in the intervals for minimal errors. Transform
  the polar coordinates r, theta into Cartesian x, y with trig
  functions with gamma &amp; beta. Least squares/ Gaussian assumes:
  1) normal curve (mean, sdev), 2) independence, 3) correct function.
  Now we use non-parametric approach which merely compares data
  with reference values to compute residuals and report the distribution.
  Currently, they use two harmonics: 24 hrs and 12 hrs.</P>
  <P>Use the timing of excess to time the treatment. <BR>
  Sphygma count, the measured blood pressure.<BR>
  Treatment.</P>
  <P>Measuring the change in amplitude due to medication, parameter
  tests with CuSums,<BR>
  Statistical Process control to determine if there is a change
  outside of the decision interval (eg.in the qsum1 goes up and
  qsum2 goes down), to indicate a change. Douglas Hawkins CuSum,
  self-starting (seeks a target), professor of statistics. Applied
  to the MESOR. Works with running means. Works with very short
  spans of data.</P>
  <P>Methods Summary: method - (hole):<BR>
  1) Least squares of BP (function, distribution of data - systemic
  lack of data eg. At night when sleeping or repeatly interrupted),
<BR>
  2) Non-parametric, residuals between measured and reference values
  regardless of function. (more difficult to get measures of uncertainty),
<BR>
  3) Measuring the change in amplitude due to medication, parameter
  tests with CuSums, (long periods of data, eg. 16 years, the cuSums
  are designed for 500 measurements, beyond that - indications
  outside the decision interval are more likely - false positives).</P>
  <P>Windowing (storing data), Compacting (process into parameters
  &amp; &quot;information) and Recycling (can write over the raw
  data). - can solve 1st order high frequency problems into lower
  frequency.</P>
  <P>Wish List<BR>
  1. Have capability to go as you go, operate without memory and
  get the entire summary. Acquire &amp; analyze simultaneously<BR>
  2. Using reference values is cumbersome, but to compute the ;
  to get a real reference database, ; accumulating reference data,
  computing reference data, following up on the people who provide
  the reference data to determine if there was morbidity and re-analyze
  the reference data. - eg. 90% prediction limits.</P>
  <P>Mary Jo - what would you like from Diaries.<BR>
  Germaine - exercise. Found that excessive amplitudes were related
  to grief, anxiety, anger, &#133; The diaries are used for descriptive
  information to determine if outlying data is significant to physical
  condition. For example if excessive emotion is brief and non-recurrent,
  no treatment may be appropriate, but if it recurs then treatment
  may be appropriate.</P>
  <P>Wade Peterson</P>
  <P>What would people want to wear? What size of unit. Power consumption?
  What can we afford in terms of current.</P>
  <P>Specific examples:<BR>
  AA or AAA, needed 3.6 volts to run it.<BR>
  Blood velocity propagation: cuff sensor affects.</P>
  <P>10 day service life<BR>
  emitter &amp; receive : $1.16</P>
  <P>His pickup circuit to &quot;this&quot; is almost the same
  as the pickup circuit to Wade's emerging design. Eg. BP via motion
  or velocity.</P>
  <P>Piezoelectric film, to power the sensor, perhaps to measure
  the blood pressure, heart rate and blood velocity.</P>
  <P>Next meeting 3/7. Continue with Wade, Mary Jo &amp; Bob. <BR>
