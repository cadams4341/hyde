<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>Our next meeting will occur on 10/10</P>

<P>Germaine reviewed a recent article submitted to the Encyclopedia
of Chronobiology. Discussed definition of chronobiology and recent
studies, including one of rats that received different treatments,
and found that the chronobiological schedule better reduced the
size of the tumor and prolonging survival. It also showed different
methods. Also showed a shift in the dominant heart rate cycle
during the first two months of life from weekly to daily cycles,
and blood pressure is similar. The analysis methods include the
arithmetic mean, MESOR, QSUMs, parameter test and estimation of
parameters, and changes in parameters. Findings include that there
is greater statistical significant with the COSINOR rather than
ANOVA, because COSINOR assumes the solution form and thus can
more accurately assess when there should be treatment.</P>

<P>Wade suggested placing it also in Wikipedia, an online open
source Encyclopedia.</P>

<P>Wade suggested a roadmap for sensors and passed out a copy
of the Twin Cities StarTribune article in 9/24/2004, showing the
impact of errors and how disastrous they are in the medical technology
industry. We have to be very sensitive to zero defect goals. StarTribune's
article 9/23/2004 summary of St. Jude's acquisition of Endocardial
Solutions. University of Minnesota Alumni Magazine's July-August
article &quot;Where Research Meets Ethics&quot;, p. 22-27, public
policy lags far behind research, and &quot;golden rice&quot; issue
of the conflict between intellectual property rights and helping
the developing world. Germaine provided the article in Engineering
and Medicine and Biology Magazine, March 1989, Vol 8, Number 1,
&quot;Impedance Techniques&quot; - the theme for the entire issue,
especially the article, &quot;Body Fluid Determinations Using
Multiple Impedance Measurement&quot; by Bob Patterson, University
of Minnesota, p. 16 describes some of the open source issues.</P>

<P>Wade thinks we need the involvement of local companies, government,
non-profits and academia all working on open source solutions.
We especially need local companies to contribute technology in
the form of techniques they developed that they've used that we
can use in the open source, he would like them to participate
in an open source group, like ours, to help us grow in number
people so that the work can get done. There just aren't enough
volunteer people to staff this project, specifically the sensor
subprojects. We need people, labs, and tools. Dennis suggested
this might not be the large companies, but the smaller companies.</P>

<P>Dennis discussed software requirements, he talked with Germaine,
followed up at the supercomputer center, and is in email discussion
with others.</P>

<P>We will begin the next meeting with a discussion of Bob's 7
problems: battery, user, sphygmomanometer, other measurements,
competitors (using ARM 7) is all of the electronics work done,
power, packaging. <BR>
