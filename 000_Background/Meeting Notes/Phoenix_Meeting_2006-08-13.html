<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P><B>Status Review:</B></P>

<P>* Larry Beatty, getting Visual Basic Unit test framework, enabling
him to write tests, then apply to Germaine's Sphygmochron prototype.</P>

<P>* Bob: Why is piezo film signal so big when you put it on a
human. The amplifier has 30 dB of gain.</P>

<P>* Mary Jo: Working on the piezo file sensor and looking at
how we are gathering the data. She is working on the second set
of data and refining it. We are comparing the Systolic with the
Chen data. We get a strong S wave, stronger than Chen, probably
because ours is mechanical, while Chen's is opto-electric. But,
the diastolic signal is weak. Next step is to get more data.</P>

<P>* Dave: Been meeting in the lab, taking various data sets,
got the oscilloscope software installed and operating, Alex has
written MatLab applications to create time series with brachial
and radial measurements, we get a good peak, but are having trouble
getting the valleys, from which the diastolic pressure is computed.
We need LabView, can obtain a student version for ~$259 that could
be transferred to the project for use. Mary Jo could buy it and
transfer ownership to the project, and Dave Skramstad sign as
Sensor project lead for the Phoenix Project. Mary Jo will examine
the license to make sure there is no prohibit on transferring
ownership to the project, make the purchase and send El the receipt.
El will use Phoenix funds reimburse Mary Jo.</P>

<P>* Mike: Will define the pressure wave as a Finite Element Analysis
(FEA) using Ansys.</P>

<P>* Alex: Developing a framework in Mathlab for analyzing waverforms.
Analyzed the first series of measurements, got a best mean squared
errors, 7 mmHg, and worst was 18 mmHg, uncertainty in the measurement.
Looking a ways to improve, look at a single measurement and average
out the noise. The way it is done is with two waveforms, on the
elbow and wrist and perform a cross correlation, using the entire
waveform. Dave said the FDA requires that error be within 8 mmHg.
Then, Penrose tubing may be another need.</P>

<P>* Gerry: Working on the clinical side, and make a more flexible
way to provide slide show presentations, web-based presentations
and files.</P>

<P><B>Topic: Systolic &amp; Diastolic Waveform questions for Germaine.</B></P>

<P>Alex: We drew graphs of the systolic and diastolic waveforms.
We got nice peaks, but very noisy measurements in the valleys.
How are these measurements performed in practice? Are there features
in the wave itself that can be used to extract the valleys?</P>

<P>Germaine: When we look at the composite pressure wave, the
systolic corresponds to the peak and the diastolic corresponds
to the valley. Some assume that 1/3 of the time in spent in Systole,
while 2/3 is spend on Diastole, though the time spent in Diastole
is variable. So you need a start point, perhaps an inflection
point of the systole rise or the peak, and use the time lag from
one point to another.</P>

<P>Diagnosis - Why Clinical Diagnosis is Different?</P>

<P>Technical Diagnosis<BR>
* Troubleshooting Man Made Systems<BR>
- Technological artifacts: Cars/Computers<BR>
* Patterns of Signs and Symptoms<BR>
- Sign: visible to an External Observable<BR>
- Symptom: Noted and Reported by the System (like computer or
car).<BR>
* Not Man-Made Systems (Yet have the Variability and Complexity
of Biological System. <BR>
- Physicians talk about differential diagnosis, sometimes a specific
set of signs and symptoms are unique to a disease and are referred
to as pathopneumonic.</P>

<P>Troubleshooting Biological Systems<BR>
- Living Organisms (and Ecosystems)<BR>
* Patterns of Signs and Symptoms (SSx)<BR>
- Signs: Visible to an External Observer<BR>
- Symptom: Known by the Organism/ Person<BR>
* Emotions: Fear / Embarrassment...<BR>
- Embarrassment to Talk about Symptoms<BR>
- Fear of Illness and Death.</P>

<P>Clinical Diagnosis<BR>
* Is your car ever Embarrassed?<BR>
* Is your Computer ever afraid?<BR>
* Clinical Diagnosis is Different from Technical Diagnosis because:<BR>
* Cars and Computer have no conscious or unconscious incentives
to conceal their Signs and Symptoms.<BR>
* People Do.</P>

<P>Summary: Why Clinical Diagnosis is Different from Technical
Diagnosis?<BR>
* Technical Diagnosis<BR>
- Troubleshooting Man-Made Systems<BR>
- Signs and Symptoms (SSx)<BR>
- No Man-Made Systems (Yet) Have the Variability and Complexity
of Biological Systems<BR>
* Clinical Diagnosis<BR>
- Troubleshooting Biological Systems<BR>
- Signs and Symptoms (SSx)<BR>
- Emotions: Fear/ Embarrassment<BR>
