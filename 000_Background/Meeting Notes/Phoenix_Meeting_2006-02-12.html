<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>Chris Adams: We discussed setting Germaine up with AIM instant
messenger for communicating. Then, we reviewed HL7 (healthcare
level 7 for ISO's OSI 7 layer communications protocols) for healthcare
interoperability into a standard information bus to reduce the
clutter. We need to address communications protocols between Phoenix
and other systems, and between the local subsystem and the remote
subsystem or reference database. Do we need the reference database
as part of Phoenix? Some said yes, others said no? We discussed
the nature of the reference database, and that it may have fractal
properties. Gerry will discuss this next meeting as a mini-topic
as a required attribute of clinical information systems. Then
we asked, does Phoenix need to have patient identities or is a
temporary number sufficient, e.g. does Phoenix need to know about
the unique person? At the time we provide the local subsystem
device to the patient, it need not have patient information, merely
device ID and session times. Chris thinks we don't need individually
identifiable patient IDs. In practice, this information is used
to create profiles, and establish reference norms for patients
by gender, age, disease history, geography and other research
useful parameters. Patient identity should remain with the clinician.
Then, where does the reference database come from? There are data
flows that flow from Phoenix and back to Phoenix. Now, how does
Phoenix function if used by non-clinicians (non-physicians), perhaps
by individuals or public health?</P>

<P>Larry Beatty: We looked at agile methodology, looked at bugs
in the prototype application, and discovered that one of the bugs
is actually a feature. We tried to set up test data and found
that it doesn't seem to deal with data with gaps, eg. daytime,
nighttime, between. Is it important to fix. Germaine said the
system should parce them and analyze the global sphygmochron and
provide warnings if there are gaps that overlap night and day,
and not provide the daytime and nighttime analysis. Another question
is, after we finish cycling, how do we document the webpage with
this product created? We decided to set up Germaine with nVu so
she can manage the webpage herself. Bob said we should add to
the Phoenix release, &quot;Application of these ideas and information
for diagnostic purposes is the sole responsibility of the person
doing it.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave Skramsted: He has been forming the sensor team, three
engineers met, brainstormed current and other technologies, and
is setting up the next meeting. He is looking for volunteers,
and looked at the patents of the Tensys system to see how it is
working,</P>

<P>Bob: He has been thinking about the device, selecting a particular
active component and getting an emulator for it, e.g. TI8051.
He found an article about it in Electronic Design, TI was doing
the same thing. He'll provide the URL. He is worried about Franz's
and Germaine's speculation that long term blood pressure changes
may be due to fluctuations in solar magnetic fields, e.g. lack
sunspots.</P>

<P>Gerry Werth's Mini-topic:<BR>
&quot;Outpatient Clinical Process - Hiding in Plain Sight&quot;</P>

<P>The Patient presented with chest pain. Procedure had the following
steps. <BR>
CC: chief complaint, Chest Pain<BR>
HPI: <BR>
PMH: <BR>
DDX: (Differential Diagnosis)<BR>
PE: Physical Exam<BR>
Objective: <BR>
Assessment: Called it an early pneumonia.<BR>
Plan:</P>

<P>Finally, he discovered it was a bowl loop It helped to talk
to the previous doctor, but there wasn't a lot of information.
This case exemplified the description by:Nemeth &amp; Cook, Journal
of Biomedical Informatics 38 [2005], 262-263.</P>

<P>&quot;healthcare work ... complex, poorly bounded, conflicted,
highly variable, uncertain, and high-tempo work domain.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Occasional visitors cannot fathom this demanding work,
much less create IT systems to support.&quot;<BR>
