  Wu Jinyi, professor doctor from China, Wujinyi@hotmail.com</P>
  <P><B>Discussion:</B><BR>
  Franz - Software and reference database is the critical portion
  of this project, Germaine can help us with this. <BR>
  Germaine - a box, telemetry, temperature sensor, can work fo
  rany other device, could work as a box in your pocket and records
  data from the sensor.</P>
  <P>Wade: two projects. <BR>
  * Oscillometric cuff ABPM | Project Champion: Bob Schlentz |
  Status: proposed project <BR>
  * Blood flow velocity ABPM | Project Champion: Wade Peterson
  | Status: proposed project <BR>
  * Sub-project: batteries | Status: active project <BR>
  Wade project lead, description complete, no activity. 3 batteries
  identified, described. Eventually intended to be extended to
  more batteries and general power sources, and linked to their
  manufacturers and data sufficient to determine whether to use
  it or not. <BR>
  - Sub-project: Piezo Film Blood Flow Sensor | Status: active
  project <BR>
  Wade project lead, prototype design, parts on order (due Thursday
  3/26), expect assembly &amp; test results by next meeting 4/4.
<BR>
  - Sub-project: Optoelectric Blood Flow Sensor | Status: proposed
  project <BR>
  Proposed project, no lead (need leader &amp; volunteers). <BR>
  - Sub-project: Piezo Film Body Motion Sensor | Status: proposed
  project<BR>
  Proposed project, no lead yet - need leader and volunteers.</P>
  <P><B>Discussion continued</B><BR>
  Wade:<BR>
  Foils and frequency range. Wade uses a little different technique.
  Uses Chen's technique and design around his claims.</P>
  <P>Sub-projects:<BR>
  * batteries<BR>
  * Piezo Film Blood Flow Sensor<BR>
  * Optoelectric Blood Flow Sensor<BR>
  * Piezo Film Body Motion Sensor</P>
  <P>Franz asked if we can arrange for some Russian work to be
  linked and perhaps translated.</P>
  <P>Status<BR>
  * batteries/power - Wade, project defined, look at batteries
  under one dollar, Uri &amp; Curt are working one.<BR>
  * Piezo Film Blood Flow Sensor<BR>
  Wade designed a circuit that doesn't infringe on a patent, thus
  is suitable for placing in public domain as open source. Casio
  developed a watch bp monitor. Not easy to use and not sensitive
  enough with people with a weak pulse. It uses an infrared diode
  and a pulse sensor at $1.70 for the pair from DigiKey at www.digikey.com,
  Optek part numbers OP140A, OP550A. <BR>
  * Optoelectric Blood Flow Sensor<BR>
  * Piezo Film Body Motion Sensor</P>
  <P>Webpage summary.<BR>
  Patent page. '<BR>
  Duke University, how to put information into the public domain.
<BR>
  Open collector. How to do Open Hardware projects.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Bob Schlentz:<BR>
  Goal is to measure blood pressure, currently measuring indirectly
  and with a bp cuff. Omron sells it for $60.<BR>
  What do we need?<BR>
  * bp cuff for calibration<BR>
  * manual sphymanometer<BR>
  To calibrate and transfer to the computer.<BR>
  Transfer of the artery, flow of blood, amt of oxygen, light,
  ultrasound, electrical device for impedance.<BR>
  Consider a cyclic wave, identify peak max (systoli) and min (diastoli)
  as the intersection of positive and negative rise/fall slopes.
  So, we need to measure and analyze. Bob has seen equipment that
  has been used in measuring heart rate, placed on arm, with sensor
  and electronics. Another uses two sensors that measures &quot;time
  of flight&quot;, measures change in diameter of artery. Depends
  on diameter of heart, valves in heart, occlusion, edema. Now
  use a slightly larger &quot;patch&quot; with an emitter and two
  sensors, and time depends on speed of flow, which depends on
  blood pressure, draws smaller battery current. Eg. Heart rate
  monitor batteries last a couple of months. Imagine a part of
  the world with moderate money, <BR>
  Possibly: Sensor 1 is 4 cm wide x 4 cm long, and a distance between
  the sensors.</P>
  <P>* In China, they have the current technology, but use the
  techniques of 100 years ago to measure bp. For example, they
  use 3 fingers - one strong pressure, one moderate pressure, one
  light pressure.</P>
  <P>Next meeting, 4/4 2:30p.</P>
