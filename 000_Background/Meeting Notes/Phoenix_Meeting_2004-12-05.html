Discussion</H3>

<P>Larry Beatty, Mike Teller and Gerry Werth joined the Phoenix
Project.</P>

<P><B>Project Status</B></P>

<P>Wade: He described alternative places to meet such as Lunds
in Plymouth to meet our growing needs for space, that has a free
conference room, $4 for 2 hrs. He provided additional material
for the bibliography page that highlights lead free electronics.
He noted that currently all circuit boards use solder and this
will change due to environmental requirements, so we must be prepared
it. This requirement starts in 13 months.</P>

<P>Germaine: Reviewed her presentation given in Taiwan. Jon asked
if the analysis pseudocode would be available. Germaine said it
would.</P>

<P>Chris-Data Analysis Software: He reviewed the &quot;actors&quot;
in the use analysis. We discussed whether the ABPM could be on
or off. The tecnician is usually a cardiology nurse or a medical
assistant or nursing assistant or nurse practicianer. Who are
the specialists who do this for that clinic. Clinicians include
physicians and nurses, OT &amp; PT, and anyone with patient contact.
The same is so for people who currently work with blood pressure
monitors. The non-physician gathers the information and the physician
determines treatment. There is a trend towards using Physician
extenders, like nurse practicianers, who determine treatment under
the nomial supervision of a physician. They are contrasted with
researchers.</P>

<P>We discussed the roles:<BR>
* first you are put in a room (rooming the patient), you may get
weighed, and provided a short interview - why are you here and
where does it hurt the worst. Data is captured. Data is analyzed.
There is a strategy session with the physician. An alternative
scenario is a screening. The other scenario is a diagnostic session.
There may be local analysis on the local device and then dumping
the data to the remote device for fuller analysis. <BR>
We identified three types of users: patients, students, bio-feedback
receipients which is possibly option but should not in the base
system if it drives cost, with an other interface to another device
like a pda.</P>

<P>This is a sequence of steps:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>front desk check in
  <LI>roomed
  <LI>interviewed
  <LI>data captured
  <LI>data analyzed
  <LI>report generated, for patient, for physician
  <LI>strategy session, where you meet with the clinician, decision
  making, reach an assessment, establish a plan, 
</UL>

<P>Blood Pressure Measurement is usually done by primary care
physicians. We had questions about what goes into a diary for
a Holter Monitor.</P>

<P>Germaine said that the ABPM diary is only used when an anomaly
is discovered and diary is examined to determine how to assess
the anomalous data. In 90% of the time, the diary is never used.
There are two numbers, D-data, E-event, date &amp; time: D, id,
; E, id, date/time, event, <BR>
Note: there is no unique patient identifier. usually name-birthdate,
to address the issue of from whom did the data come. Deal with
Munchhausen syndrome and by proxy.</P>

<P>We noted two additional items: 1) We want to learn how a physician
learns how to use a Holter Monitor. Then, we can apply this to
the Phoenix ABPM. 2) Chris noted that there is an open source
a web ring of open source medical and found it by 'googling' on
&quot;open source medical&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Our next meeting will occur on 12/19. Then, in January we'll begin
meeting on the 2nd and 4th Sunday of every month.</P>
