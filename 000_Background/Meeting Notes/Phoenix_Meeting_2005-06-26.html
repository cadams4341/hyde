<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>To introduce the Phoenix Project to our new members, El summarized
the overall project goal, Dave summarized the hardware projects
and Chris summarized the systems engineering requirements and
software projects.  <BR>
Chris discussed the subsystems, especially the diary.<BR>
- Germaine added that user baseline information that is collected
needs to include: gender, age,  medication, <BR>
SOAP: subjective (diary), objective (initial information about
the patient), Assessment, Plan.  <BR>
History: history of present illness, daily progress notes include
the phenomenon and other.  Then, the analysis program needs to
be able to deal with multiple profiles, each of which is a contiguous
measurement sequence that begins at one time and ends at another
time.   The reference values from one profile can be used or updated
to other profiles for the same person.  Or reference data may
be updated for the entire system.  </P>

<P>Chris noted that patient medical history is outside the project
scope, but we need basic patient identification information. 
<BR>
Gerry noted that much of health informatics lately has been organized
around Health Level 7, HL7.  We would like to learn more about
HL7 so that we can determine which of the interface specifications
are relevant to us, to which we need to comply, and how it will
help us determine how to organize our information.   </P>

<P>Chris will identify what of HL7 we need to know and report
back to us. </P>

<P>Chris noted that new reference data may be available and the
clinician determines when to update.  </P>

<P>John asked if we could interface a generic analysis program
so that we don't have to develop it.  Germaine said that A&amp;D
produces their own which must be installed and de-installed after
every use.  So we concluded that we must develop the analysis
program.  Much of the analysis the Halberg Chronobiology Center
performs is done within their own DOS-based program that was originally
written in Fortran and is available to us.  Post-analysis is done
on Excel.  We'll need to perform the same analysis within the
data analysis portion of Phoenix.    <BR>
Chris asked what Phoenix must do and what it does not need to
do. </P>

<P>Then, we discussed what is the minimal information Phonenix
could produce that would be useful.  Establish that as Phase 1,
then add another phase that extends it. It needs to identify the
patient, and identify the values (Patient ID, HR, BP, x3, x4,
diary value, time).  Furthermore, it must be comparable to the
Sphygmometer measurements for BP, therefore it should have been
calibrated before and after. </P>

<P>Chris identified six applications needed in the local (wearable)
subsystem:<BR>
1. Clock<BR>
2. Diary<BR>
3. Device status<BR>
4. Biometrics (display)<BR>
5. Data acquisition<BR>
6. Data transfer</P>

<P>The sampling interval may vary during the measurement.  <BR>
In more detail:<BR>
1. Clock: for diary recording, time, not date but not display,
 time stamp format is: yr, mo,day,hr,min. <BR>
Bob said we don't want to confuse: accuracy, resolution and interval.
 The interval is one minute. Currently, the A&amp;D ABPM takes
around two minutes from the time it begins to take a measurement
and the time it displays the result.  The intervals are in increments
of minute.  <BR>
Bob notes that non-sphygmometer devices typically provide measurments
every heart beat, approximately every second.  Therefore, we think
that the sample rate would occur everry 10-20 msecs, or precision
= 1.  <BR>
Gerry noted that sampling Beat-to-beat may occur at 300 beats
per minute during tachycardia or arrhythmia.  Or 300 beats per
minute x 25 samples per cycle = 7500 samples per minute. Timestamps
will include data, timestamps in UCT, localized display, time,
date and timezone are set a initialization, 10 v per meter (FDA
guidelines for EMC).  We discussed where there are requirements
to endure an MRI measurement and Chris noted that there are MRI
requirements for pacemakers.  Bob said that meant that the pacemaker
would not be pulled out of the chest by a 1.5 Tesla field. Chris
noted that we should consider these requirements and document
how we made the decision.  </P>

<P>We will meet next at 7/10, but not the 7/24 Sunday.  Similarly
we will meet 8/14, but not 8/28.  </P>
