<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>Chris and Gerry are starting clinical care support system,
which will support the needs of 1-10 physician practices. We are
venturing it as a subproject of Phoenix to help it begin and we
expect it to spinoff as a separate project aligned with Phoenix
as a reference model and a specific system with which the Phoenix
ABPM will communicate.</P>

<P>Germaine continued her presentation on blood pressure <A HREF="../../Phoenix_Bibliography.htm#anchor19202">data
analysis</A>, covering slides 36 through 42, focusing on individual
profiles with which an abnormality (eg. above 95 percentile or
below 5 percentile can be identified.</P>

<P>Gerry presented a 15 minute clinical information system mini-topic.
A key objective of clinical information systems is to automate
the patient chart. Then, you need to address the impact of clinical
uncertainty. Therapeutic rapport is essential. A physician never
has all of the informaqtion that might be desirable to make q
decision. Many who are building electronic medical records ignore
the patient in their systems model. Open-Ended clinical nomenclature
means you often trying to describe conditions for which there
are not always terms and definitions.</P>

<P>Our next meeting will be on Oct. 9.</P>
