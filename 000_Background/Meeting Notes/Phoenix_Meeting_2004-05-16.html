<B>Demonstrations &amp; General Discussion</B><BR>
The new A&amp;D 2430 is a low power blood pressure monitor. <BR>
Cuffless BP monitor is the goal, however, US certification can
be difficult. <BR>
The A&amp;D 2425 has an activity sensor.</P>

<P>Bob summarized characteristics, needs and problems with current
blood pressure monitors. See his <A HREF="../../Phoenix_Bibliography.htm#anchor55316">presentation</A>,
linked to these notes.</P>

<P>Wade is building an inexpensive fixture to simulate blood pressure
characteristics of an arm to support repetitive sensor measurements,
tuning and tuning. The current technique is using velocity to
measure pressure.</P>

<P>Franz noted that multiple week measurements were useful in
determining an individual's weekly blood pressure cycle, but once
determined, it was useful immediately. For example, changes in
the weekly blood pressure cycle after surgery is often an early
indicator of infection, and can occur long before body temperature
increases.</P>

<P>Franz said that body temperature would be a useful additional
measure.</P>

<P>Furthermore, he said that it isn't necessary that ambulatory
blood pressure measurements be comparable with the standard cuff
measure. Instead, clinical outcomes are important, and demonstrating
that non-cuff blood pressure measurements are effective in preventing
strokes, heart attacks and infections is far more important than
showing that they are comparable to the standard cuff.</P>

<P>We asked:<BR>
1) What will change in blood pressure product technology in the
next 5 years? Answer: No fundamental changes. <BR>
2) Is there an inherent difference in accuracy between piezo and
cuff based blood pressure monitors? Answer: Piezo is potentially
as accurate as cuff-based products. However, it is more costly
to produce, and the electrical characteristics of the piezo material
tend to change over time and that is costly to prevent. Additionally,
measurements from blood pressure monitors must be comparable to
the cuff monitor in order to satisfy market and regulatory requirements.
