<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>John Sawyer, from LSI Logic, joined us. He is interested in
hardware and sensors.</P>

<P>Project Status: <BR>
Chris: working on embedded system requirements</P>

<P>Mary Jo: got a board working, is working on a sensor, then
calibration, generating data,</P>

<P>John will be on remote assignment,</P>

<P>Gerry Werth. Discussing with Kip Sullivan the arguments and
evidence for and against the use of electronic medical records.
Especially, the use of evidence based research, public policy
and decisions. Gerry recommended nVu.</P>

<P>Germaine: Continued around <A HREF="../../Phoenix_Bibliography.htm#anchor19202">slide
61</A>. reviewing non-parametric models that complement parametric
models that do not assume normality of the data or that the variance
is the same over time. They just show the values and generally
a specified confidence interval. Eg. a specified endpoints, and
show the patient's profile which is deviant and over what percent
of the time, and when. Therefore, treatments may be different
based on amount of deviation and when during the cycle. <BR>
Germaine: We would like the ability to support changing the reference
values, using reference values for specific ages, gender, country
of origin, etc. It is better when the groups are more homogeneous,
it may provide more useful clinical information.</P>

<P>Chris: Should we have the structures that will support double-blind
studies?</P>

<P>Gerry Presented on Clinical Information Systems</P>

<P>- Vertical structure of Clinical Information.</P>

<P>- Elementary particles<BR>
- atmosphere<BR>
amino acid<BR>
protein<BR>
membrane<BR>
organelle<BR>
cell<BR>
organ<BR>
animal<BR>
man<BR>
family<BR>
tribe<BR>
social, economic, political structure</P>

<P>In medicine, information is organized by these levels and is
useful Emergent properties, from lower levels to higher. That
may become embedded. Chemistry is a horizontal disciple, medicine
is a vertical discipline. Software functionality over time for
knowledge workers.</P>

<P>Time (x), Functionality (y).<BR>
- General business systems increase in both variables.<BR>
- Knowledge work systems, begin with a minimal functionality.</P>
