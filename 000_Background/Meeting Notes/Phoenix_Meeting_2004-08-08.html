<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>Our next meeting will occur on 8/22 with the following meeting
on 9/12.</P>

<P>Bob notes that monitoring blood pressure could be used to identify
the onset of HIV, provided as part of a thesis defense in the
University of Minnesota's neuroscience department last week.</P>

<P>Germaine asked that we add heart rate to the requirements to
clarify that it includes both blood pressure and heart rate.</P>

<P>John asked if we are looking at Omnron's blood pressure monitor.
Omron and A&amp;D have the leading market shares in the home blood
pressure market. Germnaine notes that Omron's product is not automated.</P>

<P>We reviewed the Regulatory Approval process, identified ANSI
standards that we would like to obtain and share, and identifed
some of the processes and documents.</P>

<P>Neil questioned the ability to convert blood velocity to blood
pressure. Wade showed that US patent # 6,599,251 has the following
formula converting blood velocity to blood pressure, P=a + b*lnT.</P>

<P>We discussed other manufacturers including Medwave, Omron and
A&amp;D, noting A&amp;D's new TM-2430 ABPM, and that Omron did
not have an automatic ABPM.</P>

<P>We developed a draft update to the Objectives page to be brief
and crystal clear to potential users and volunteer engineers,
why this project is important. <BR>
