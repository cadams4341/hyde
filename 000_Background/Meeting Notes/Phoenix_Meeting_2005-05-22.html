<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P><B>Ralph Cardinal</B>, Director of Hardware Engineering at
Guidant, presented to us on testing in the design phase. He gave
us permission to post his presentation and you can view it by
clicking <A HREF="../../0001_Bibliography/Testing%20in%20the%20Design%20Phase.ppt">here</A>.
It is also posted on our <A HREF="../../Phoenix_Bibliography.htm#anchor464235">Bibliography
page</A>. He tailored his presentation to address our questions:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>What does software need to create for the testers, especially
  if testing is done before the software exists?
  <LI>What does design phase testing mean?
  <LI>How should software developers approach testing? Do they
  need to think in a specific process? Do they need to create a
  test, eg. test driven development?
  <LI>What does it mean to the integrity of the test process if
  testers are part of the design process? How do they remain separate
  and 'part of the loyal opposition'?
</UL>

<P>Ralph asked if there is any evidence that BP cycle measurement
improves healthcare. Germaine summarized the data and outcome
studies.</P>

<P>He introduced design analysis testing (DAT). It addresses design
intent, whitebox testing, not blackbox, and the testers must have
intimate knowledge of the design detail.</P>

<P>Q: How do you decide what the intended use is, do you have
to account that products may be used in unintended ways? <BR>
A: DAT is one level above the requirements, it is looser, with
a broad view, not narrow view.</P>

<P>Design Verification Testing (DVT). Demonstrates that the specified
requirements have been met. These groups of tests are sometimes
called QA, blackbox testing, and the testers have no knowledge
of the design.</P>

<P>Design validation demonstrates that the system conforms to
user needs and intended uses. Here, you bring in customers and
have them perform testing, use models and prototypes, learn how
they are going to use it and their expectation. Often it is called
systems testing, GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice), testing on
real people, and can even be test by sales reps if formalized.
It can be called design validation if it is done by the people
who designed it, but not on the same spot.</P>

<P>These are the three types of testing. At a high level all forms
of this testing are similar because FDA requires it, but at a
lower level it differs by degree of automation. In Europe, one
must assure it conforms to 13485.</P>

<P>As the design changes, the plans and protocols change. Then
you test, and write the report. All tests are expected to pass
100% otherwise a justification must be written. The best way is
to continually test.</P>

<P>A protocol is a scenario description to test, the how to test.
The plan says what to test and the protocol is how to test.</P>

<P>Development testing is a looser version of that. DAT testing
is the development testing.</P>

<P>Q: Given our <A HREF="../Phoenix_Roadmap.htm">Roadmap</A>,
when must we begin testing?<BR>
A: In your productization phase, when you make the product manufacturable.
However, DAT would be beneficial during your prototyping to catch
errors and to prototype your testing capability. <BR>
</P>

<P>IEEE has a standard for Verification and Validation for Software
testing. It is standard engineering for best practices.</P>

  Requirements</A> page.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Sometimes, companies develop and 'throw it over the wall'.
They have different groups for design and crash testing. The rationale
for testing is: If the defects are found earlier, it costs less
to fix them.</P>

<P>He reviewed test approaches.</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Gated Model: Design part, then testers test that part.
  <LI>Spiral Model: when features are done, the test is done and
  it can be run. Defects are spiraled back into the design.
  <LI>V-Model: Develop design and tests in parallel using common
  requirements. It requires great communication and excellent requirements.
</UL>

<P>You must have requirements in order to test.</P>

<P>What looks bad to FDA is if you try something, it doesn't work,
and you try to hide it. If you try it, it doesn't work, you report
it, then try something else, and iterate until you find something
that works, but report continually.</P>

<P>What to test: Hardware, Software, System,</P>

<P>Test at the interfaces, have good requirements around the interfaces.</P>

<P>Regulatory Expectations: Verification and Validation, and Documentation.
For Class II, they still expect V&amp;V, design history file,
record decisions and why, justification, safe and reliable. Increasingly,
Human Interface and Human Factors is being done, especially for
software, and is highlighted by the AMI (American Association
for Medical Instrumentation). <BR>
<BR>
Q: Does FDA come to our site?<BR>
A: No, just reports.</P>

<P>Q: What about ISO?<BR>
A: A notified body, like TUV comes. Guidant uses the British standards.</P>

<P>Good Practices - continued ...<BR>
<BR>
For Peer Reviews, an independent team from outside the organization
is not required. If the team that validates is managed by the
development team, this will be questioned by FDA.</P>

<P>Inspection is going through the code with another coder.</P>

<P>FDA wants a planned, methodical, and documented test process
and execution. You can fail and explain, but you may wish not
to send anything that says &quot;failed&quot;, but explain that
it was outside reasonable bounds, then you changed something,
and it passed. Or the color requirement says it should be yellow,
not red, it wasn't so you went with it anyway because it didn't
affect safety or efficacy. If you change something, use Ripple
Analysis, and test what it affects, e.g. another 20 screens. Finish
the protocol as much as you can before you make changes. Don't
justify it as &quot;engineering judgment&quot;.</P>

<P>What does software need to create for testers? They need requirements.
Only include those who are needed on reviewing requirements, eg.
concept would include marketing, but software requirements would
not, nor would it include electrical or mechanical, and vice-versa.</P>

<P>Analysis testing includes DAT/or scripted testing, united,
integration, possibly automated. Include the plan, methodology,
protocols, use cases, report.</P>

<P>It is commonly believed that IV&amp;V is better, but this is
not necessary.</P>

<P>What does it mean to the integrity of the test process if testers
are part of the design process? Integrity isn't the issue, coverage
is. Testers need to be testing the areas they have not participated
in.</P>

<P>How do they remain separate and 'part of the loyal opposition'?
You can use a separate team. Or with smaller teams, one team can
test software module they haven't worked on and vice versa, the
other team can test their module.<BR>
Inspection in the design phase yields many benefits.</P>

<P>Q: How do you find the unanticipated, especially biological,
effects. For example, a change in a pacemaker case that created
a 'hole' in the case led to growths in a hole in the embedded
product. <BR>
A: This should be covered in the hazard analysis. Brainstorm about
what could happen. Don't allow last minute changes without hazard
analyses. Have someone identified as the safety person who anticipates
what could affect hazards.</P>

<P>Labeling includes anything written, on the screen, anything
that comes out as documentation to the public. <BR>
Requirements are not labeling, and design history file isn't either.
Labeling includes the user manual and patient manual.</P>

<P>Q: What is most difficult, FDA or ISO? <BR>
A: For Class II, it is very similar. FDA is a little more difficult
because it focuses on safety and efficacy. ISO focuses only on
safety. For any Class III (drugs and implantables), they want
efficacy, but typically not for class II. FDA wants to know if
it really works.</P>

<P>Guidant has used agile methods, team programming, PSP, it worked
quite well. They use a dedicated team and they make the choice,
so it that hasn't been consistent. Typically, a team is formed,
executes, and is broken up afterwards.</P>

<P>Q: When we do the hazard analysis, with dire effects, what
do we do with it?<BR>
A: Mitigate it.</P>

<P><BR>
Q: What tools do you use? For example, do you use ADA?<BR>
A: ADA doesn't work well with embedded products.</P>

<P>For software: C is good, choose a methdology, agile if fine.
Or divvy out the requirements and go for it. Use what you are
familiar with. Use the same methodology for the entire project.</P>

<P>For hardware: Programmable parts, same as how you've been doing
it for years.</P>

<P>There is nothing unique about medical other than regulatory
requirements and good practices. Therap, Thiac4 (sp?), it had
a software fault and delivered too much gamma radiation. After
that it showed up again and again, and was never corrected in
the field. It started FDA's focus on software.</P>

<P>For system: MS Word works fine, XML for tags works for traceability,
you can tag a requirement. Stay away from big requirements analysis
systems for this project.</P>

<P>Open source defect tracking systems, CVS has worked well.</P>

<P>Ralph concluded his presentation and said he would be happy
to return to address additional questions. We thanked him for
his excellent presentation.</P>

<P><B>Projects Status Review.</B></P>

<P>* Germaine: reviewed some data formats with Dennis. Dennis
and Chris are trying to . Interval, length of record, (24 hrs,
48 hrs, new ones are 7 days, and longer), some have holes and
gaps, age groups, centenarians, contained projects to find association
with melatonin.</P>

<P>* Wayne: breadboarding a circuit, Asked for another Sensor
team: evenings, not Monday. Weekend works well in the evening.
Possibly 6/4-5.</P>

<P>* Tom: organizing his project for testing. He'll send El a
project plan to post for his project page and El will send him
a logon to his page.</P>

<P>* Gerry: working to get back into pediatrics, will have new
scenarios for clinical practice, working with Dr. Milt Seifert
on patient-care software, healthy business model for healthcare.
Why healthcare is such a bizarre process to model, very applicable
for mass customization, and why this is such a good fit.</P>

<P>* Dennis: http://wlakb.editme.com, click on Public Pages, then
scroll down and click on Phoenix Project. <A HREF="http://wlakb.editme.com/PhoenixProject">Here</A>.
It is another wiki, used by Breakthough Thinking, another study
group he is participating in. he Set up a Phoenix table for blood
pressure. Began a discussion of data forms.</P>

<P>* Larry: Looking for a software project to do this summer.</P>

<P>* Dave: Getting lab access at the UofM, got parts on order
to reproduce what Wade has done with the Piezo Film Sensor.</P>

<P>Our next general Phoenix meeting occurs on June 12. El will
schedule a sensor team meeting for Dave, Wayne, Tom and El during
the 6/4-5 weekend.</P>
