<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>Status Review:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Mary Jo: close to obtaining all of the piezo film components.
  Then, she will implement and analyze the results.
  <LI>Gerry Werth: Investigating how clinical information is coded,
  especially in Pediatrics, and is collaborating with Vergi Slee.
  <LI>Dennis: offered to navigzte the unversity hierarchy to get
  a universal IP for a wiki. Get an IP, a machine installed and
  deploy it. Trun suggested filesanywhere.com will provide free
  universal IPs, 10 MB, used by organizations that need a point
  beyond their firewall.
  <LI>Germaine: working on an automated Cosinor program that implements
  the data analysis presentation in an <BR>
  Excel spreadsheet. She expects to complete it by next meeting.
  Also, she discussed the ABPM discussed and informed by Larry
  Beatty in Electronic Design, Tensys, PL150 ,
  <LI>Norm Bayne joined us and will work on a quality system, and
  Trung Le joined us.
</UL>

<P>Chris Adams continued leading development of system requirements,
using MyPage, 2005-12-11.pdf or ppt. He summarized the major subsystems
and interfaces including ABPM, ABP diary, Data Analysis Software,
Medical Records System, ABPM wearer, ABPM administrator, physiologist.</P>

<UL>
  <LI>The device itself is a realtime embedded system. What are
  the hard realtime vs soff realtime system requirements. In hard
  realtime systems, missing means the system fails. In soft realtime
  requirements, a recovery or alternative path is used to continue.
  <LI>Device Subsystem portions: <BR>
  - clock: sample beat to beat, 1 ms resolution.
  <LI>Questions: what information do we need about the wearer.
<BR>
  Bob: We only need the serial number of the instrument. The rest
  of the information that maps the instrument and time to the patient
  identify. (PII - personal identifiable information). <BR>
  Trun: Unique device identifier, and patient. Needs to be encrypted
  for wireless and HIPPA. <BR>
  Chris: We need to trace data to a device and to an individual.
  The system is intended to be highly modular. <BR>
  Norm: We might want a dual system for quality. <BR>
  Bob: For any number, you would like redundancy for error correction
  . <BR>
  Trun: MAC addresses are getting full, instead use RFID number.
  128 bytes.
</UL>

<P>Gerry Werth: Clinical Information System mini-topic.</P>

<UL>
  <LI>The System is Losing Data.
  <LI>1978: What does final mean, or RTFM. (read the fine manual)<BR>
  2005: Coding,
  <LI>1978: Fungal Infection, Grand Rounds- the lab was unable
  to grow the organism. Lab: the system is losing data. RFTM: fungal
  cultures never say 'fuinal' on the printed report. MNediuical
  RRecords: discard paper if it didn tnot say 'final'.
  <LI>2005: The system will not alloww the exact diagnosis to be
  recorded. No codes exist for the final system.
  <LI>Diagnostis/Code/Classification.<BR>
  - Diagnosis: free text used by trhe doctor.<BR>
  - Code: a thinkg substituted for something else.<BR>
  - Codes are Identifiers<BR>
  - Classification are Organizers - sets of pigeonholes in which
  to place other things.
  <LI>Flaws in Coding/Classification<BR>
  - Diganostic entity: no way to capture the permanent codes, exact
  diagnosis which the physician records.<BR>
  - Classification set: we can't tell what individal codes mean
  because they contain no identifiers.We must make a single classification,
  ICD-9-C, serves all purposes.<BR>
  - One Classification Fits All.<BR>
  - EMR The electronic medical record typically sacrifices completeness
  and accuracy for convenience in data input.
  <LI>Social Informatics:<BR>
  - Initially, we must do hypothesis generating, then hypothesis
  proving.<BR>
  . Therefore, clinical computing and business computing are different
  subspecialties of computing.
