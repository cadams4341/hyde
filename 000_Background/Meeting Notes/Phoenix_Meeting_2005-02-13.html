Discussion</H3>

<P>* Andrei Khodak, of Advanced Bionics, Inc, joined us. He has
a research and development background in blood pressure, fluid
interaction, and computation fluid dynamics.</P>

<P>* Max Cortner, Director of Testing at Guidant, will present
to us at our next meeting on medical device testing. Chris wants
to hear what testing we need to do as an open source community
because we come from companies with cultures who have a tradition
of testing. However, in open source organizations we can't afford
that cost structure, but we still need to do testing. So, what
should we do, how do we adapt and what can we avoid that is just
culture.</P>

<P>Dennis: Looing at repository tools, doesn't like CVS, looking
at TLA, Arch,subversion, in CVS he doesn't easily enable to reorganizing
the code, doesn't allow you to create new directories, delete
and rename old directories.</P>

<P>Gerry: Monitoring groups, need for medical vocabulary, interachinge
information with medical personal, looking at open source projects.
There have bween other attempts, UNMLS universial medial language
system, meta thesaurus, may become open. For auditing records,
just keep all of the old records, e.g. in medical records, you
have to keep all of the records, never forgets all of the old
records. FDA is using that culture, all of the old versions of
the specifications.</P>

<P>Wade: suggested www.21cfrpart11.com, solution providers, electronic
ocument management systems. We should look at these, they specialize
in handling and storing these documents. Is there an open source
product that will take our information and provide a 21CFR Part
11 compliant verision that is auditable. Also, look at their discussion
group, it is a Yahoo Group. &quot;21CFRPart11 mailing list&quot;.
We need to capture data and the design history file. Gerry will
look at this and let us know.</P>

<P>El: will add the link to the full 21CFR Part 11 to the medical
regulations webpage. <A HREF="http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_04/21cfr11_04.html">www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_04/21cfr11_04.html
</A><BR>
Start with scope.</P>

<P>Wade: Received a package from Conductive Technologies, Mike
Flickinger, sent a blank with a square field that you can cut
out the electrode, atttach three tails, then use a conductive
epoxy. Wondered if you just use a glue, or their own proprietary
adhesive. We are reluctant to go with a proporietary solution
because we are trying to create an open marketplace for people
to compete for best price and service. We are trying to create
a marketplace for ABPM.</P>

<P>Bob: Asked where Franz' additions to the mission.</P>

<P>El: We changed the definitions of 'unobtrusive' and 'easy to
use' which are linked on every use of it on the webpage. We don't
want to change the mission statement, because that may require
a restart of the Phoenix Project, but we structured it so that
it is flexible enough to accommodate change through 'clarification'
of the words used in its definition.</P>

<P>Bob: There is encouraging news of the last issue of EE Times
of open source products for the 3rd world, eg. a bicycle powered
computer.</P>

<P>Germaine: It is possible that Miguel Rebilla, a mathematician
and webmaster of the Halberg Chronobiology Center, may be interested
in participating in the Phoenix Project. He has worked on Cosignor
function for Chronobiology, using Matlab.</P>

<P>Regarding the platform for developing software, between</P>

<P>Input example, VBA program, output example, statistics routine,
enhancements that allow for handling infinite amout of data.</P>

<P>Chris Adams: Just accepted a position with United Health Group
as a senior business analyst based in part on presentation of
his work with Phoenix, where he will focus on systems requirements
analysis. Questions include: do we want to do test driven development.
He took us through his presentation. Today we will focus on User
Roles and requirements. We envision the system comprising four
parts, 1) the local wearable subsystem, 2) the remote data analysis
workstation subsystem, 3) the physiologist's analysis system -
the baseline manasgement workstation which uses a profile of the
patient (e.g a 35 yr old male) and allows them to create new profiles
and modify existing profils, and 4) a diary which includes information
about each measurement to interpret each measurement. The diary
is essential and will be unique to Phoenix, because no other ABPM
incorporates a diary into it. It is a major issue in making sense
of the blood measurements.</P>

<P>Germaine: The diary is most useful in determining what the
patient's activity at the time of measurement. Currently, the
data is the sum of all the data, with the diary, you can interrogate
the data and categorize it based on activity, sleep, wake, exercise,
and other activity, changing the time base and activity base.</P>

<P>Chris: We can separate out the work of the Daa Analysis Workstation:
heavy data modeling, XML, some commuiniocation modules in both
the data analysis (remote) and the blood collection (local) system.
It will have a display, because the patient will need this information,
their will be a keyboard to provide commands, a processor, and
an applications layer to enable processing.</P>

<P>The Actor/Users: The scenarios we previously identified are
more limited than we thought. A monitor wearer - we need another
label which describes the user not what they do. Other class of
user are administrators, who get the data out of the device and
provide it to others, including physicians, technicians, pharmacuests
or a self-care person. There are multiple kinds of clinicians:
Primary Care physician,specialist, nurse. The last major role
is the physiologist.</P>

<P>The stakeholders include: health insurance companies, inspector/auditors/regulatory
agencies, and clinicians.</P>

<P>Actors includes: Patients (wearers), speicalist, clinicians,
physician, nurse.</P>

<P>Summary Use Cases inlcude: 1) Rehabillitiation for clinical
trial and clinical practice, and 2) Prehabilitation for self-care
or education. We suggested others including 3) public health where
a government or non-for-profit agency to gather information on
the health of a population, 4) research - evidence-based medicine,
5) Insurance programs while implement illness preveniont discounts
and wellnes programs.</P>

<P>Next step: we need story writing for each of these to capture
the requirements. Example: A patient checks into a clinic, nurse
collects a patient history, doctor looks at it and says to the
patient that they are a candidate for a program, they patient
agrees, they sign agreement forms, they give the patient the device,
train them in their use, and create a schedule of use and visit
to the clinic, the program is conducted and completed, the data
is collected and analyzed, data submitted to the originating organiztaion
and used in the following way. Gerry will write stories on primary
care, nurses perspective, wearer/patient. Bob will write a narrative
on the application in the hospital. Germaine will write a narrative
form the chronomics analysis perspective - included as part of
her document on blood pressure analysis including input - analysis
method - output, or just give us references to such articles.
El will write stories about public health and insurance. Dennis
will write a story about Self-care.</P>

<P><BR>
Education: Germaine described how they used slumber parties to
discuss it and learn that there were blood pressure variations.</P>

<P>Our next meeting will occur on February 27th.<BR>
