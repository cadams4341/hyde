Clinical Care Support Systems - Mini-Topic - Gerry Werth</H3>

<P>A Clinical Care Support System (CCS)</P>

<P>CCS: How Shall We Proceed<BR>
* Clinical Care and IT<BR>
* Consensus<BR>
* Next</P>

<P>CCS: Health Care and IT<BR>
* Ephriam Schwarz, &quot;Reality Check&quot;, Infoworld, 20006.12.04<BR>
&quot;The future is rosy for both patient care and computer science.
... As healthcare goes high tech, IT expertise will be needed
more than ever to manage the new systems.<BR>
&quot;<BR>
* EMR: Electronic Medical Record<BR>
- Supports Clinical Care Process.<BR>
* PHR: Personal Health Record<BR>
- Supports Personal Responsibility for one's own Health.<BR>
* Intel and Walmart initiative.</P>

<P>Concerns and Issues<BR>
* Clinical Informatics is the most complex domain.<BR>
* Who will join a CCSS group?<BR>
* Who will be our4 alpha users?</P>

<P>Next Steps<BR>
* Decided who to decide.<BR>
* Recruit members for CCSS study group.<BR>
* Recruit alpha user sites.<BR>
* ...</P>

<P>Q&amp;A<BR>
* Requirements to start? People to join. <BR>
- coders, Gerry is the domain expert and architect. <BR>
- builders.<BR>
- how do we position and market it. Sales and market position.
Professional politics and cultures. Getting to the Pediatrics
Academy. Open source marketing is recruiting.<BR>
* The skills/functions needed:<BR>
- BSA. <BR>
- architectural designer, <BR>
- marketing organization - to recruit, ... <BR>
- leadership and management role. Marketing is community building
and recruiting, also project/program management. <BR>
Start with coordinator role, then expand to project manager, then
program manager. The role is to assure that Gerry's vision is
implemented.</P>

<P>* What are the counter-forces? What are the minimal things
it needs to do?</P>

<P>We concluded that he needs a coordinator, a business systems
analyst and an architectural designer.</P>

<P>We asked Gerry if he had a vision statement and was ready to
start. He said he thinks he is ready, wants to think about time,
will update the vision page at<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.phoenix.tc-ieee.org/016_Clinical_Care_Support_System/Clinical_Care_Support_System.htm">www.phoenix.tc-ieee.org/016_Clinical_Care_Support_System/Clinical_Care_Support_System.htm</A>
, and he will let us know. When he is ready, we are ready to staff
it.</P>

<H3>Sphygmochron Vision - Larry Beaty</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Questions of: <BR>
* Is the code public domain or private.<BR>
* Franz seems to feel that the real value is the patient database.
What do we do with it and how?</P>

<P>Chris noted that keeping the patient identities out of the
&quot;product&quot; makes it possible to easily satisfy the regulatory
requirement.</P>

<P>Larry talked about the requirements changing as Franz and Germaine
saw what could be done in a program. We discussed capturing what
they do now, and automating it as &quot;version 1&quot;. If the
patient data goes into a text file, Version-1 could be constrained
to do that; if Germaine has to retrieve other measurements for
this patient from another text file, it could include this as
an automated function. <BR>
