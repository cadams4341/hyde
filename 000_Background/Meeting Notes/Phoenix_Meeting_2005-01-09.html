Discussion</H3>

<P>Our next meeting will occur on January 23rd and we'll continue
meeting each 2nd and 4th Sunday of the month.</P>

<P>Franz asked us to emphasize that the ABPM is both automatic
and usable in the home, and use should not be restricted to just
a hospital, clinic or doctor's office.</P>

<P>We continued developing software requirements. Chris summarized
our software requirements project, specifically the Use Case process.</P>

<P>We are extending our user profiles beyond the typical criteria
of: male/female and under 40/over 40 years old.</P>

<P>We discussed the diary. Franz suggested that we include: waking,
exercise, emotions, conflict, grief, mood. needs time stamp. The
main categories are 1) mood (scale) and 2) activity. We realized
we needed to include food/drink/missing a meal and 3) Ad Hoc.</P>

<P>There was a local newspaper article about 14 high school students
who won an award in diary design for blood pressure measurement.
We need to interview them before the information is lost and the
students leave the area for college. Specifically we want to know:
What information they recorded, how they recorded it, what would
they do differently, the positives and negatives of what they
did. The article was about Richie and Ryan in the Minneapolis
Paper, finished on 12/21, in the high school news section. Franz
will send us a copy of the article.</P>

<P>Use Cases - The key actors include:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Patients: typical patient vs. the athlete patient who may
  want biofeedback information.
  <LI>Clinicians: primary care physicians, non-physicians direct
  contact. Anyone who is in direct patient contact is considered
  a clinician.
  <LI>Physiologists.
</UL>

<P>We are not clear on whether Technicians are actors.</P>

<P>Clinicians are divided into roles: physician, nurse, educating
patient &amp; fitting and training, trouble-shooting &amp; phone
support, follow-up, return device. These are roles at the beginning,
middle and end of patient use.</P>

<P>We discussed how physicians are continually characterizing
reliability in terms of their uncertainty and their uncertainty
about their uncertainty. Also, physician information is highly
context-based, and this is often difficult for engineers to understand.</P>

<P>We noted the issue of &quot;Is the diary physically separate
from the monitor?&quot;</P>

<P>We also discussed what is an appropriate sampling cycle and
to use the monitor to do this. We decided that we need to configure
the monitor to accept different intervals other than just 30 minutes.
Also, Franz suggested that the data need not be equidistant, though
this is highly desirable. We noted that A&amp;D's monitor has
intervals of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60, 120 minutes. Bob noted that
5 minute intervals are used immediately following surgery to determine
when and if key patient metrics return to normal values.</P>

<P>We also need types of alarms. The hardware needs to have it
so that software can implement it. Such alarms need to be: 1)
get to the hospital now, 2) take a specified action. We noted
that having an alarm that indicated a specific action other than
'call your doctor' could require much more rigorous regulatory
approval.</P>

<P>What is the difference between clinics and public health? Franz
said that restrictions are often reduced for public health because
they do preventative medicine and clinics do more clinical (post
event) medicine. Gary said that public health treats populations
and a clinic treats individuals.</P>
