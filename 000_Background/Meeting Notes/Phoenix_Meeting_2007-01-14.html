<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>* Franz: Announced that they have discovered a 1.3 year cycle
of suicides in Minnesota and Japan, expected to be caused by a
solar wind.<BR>
* Yoshi: Presented his latest work. 95% confidence interval of
a 1.3 year cycle, of heart rate from 14 days of birth. Showed
that heart rate component became more prominent with age. Found
that diastolic pressure was synchronized to 1 year but systolic
seemed to be synchronized to 1.2 and increased to 1.3 as age increased.
Correlation was stronger when measured at night.  Possible explanations
are that the solar wind has an average period of 1.3 years, is
mediated by ionized particles, primarily alpha particles, that
are guided around the earth's magnetosphere to the night side
and then through to the earth's surface.  <BR>
