<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P><B>Status Review:</B></P>

<P>* Gerry: Tracked down Tringa, Virgil Sleeve, when you are using
ICD, designed for pathology, you are not tracking illnesses in
medical records, but several hierarchical categories above, e.g.
west nile fever is grouped with , accession number. A new technique
is to track the current coding and usages, to capture the item
and physicians phrasing. Eg. HIV is coded as HTLV3, human xx lymphocyte
virus 3, associated with t cells. The problem is that when an
illness is not yet associated with its cause, it is an impedance
mismatch, and are referred to a set of symptoms. There is no gold
standard for reality in clinical diagnosis. No absolute reference
standard. It is a record of physician perceptions. It should have
a facility for natural language (for different meanings), open
ended (for new discoveries), for trending you need an object that
knows the coding standard used, real-time extensibility of the
coding system including interim coding systems. Tringa (company
in St. Paul MN) and Dr. Vergil Slee</P>

<P>* Chris Fuller: There are standards, ASTM E31.28 CCE standard,
trying to integrate that with HL7, Solventus.com has a website
has an example of a clinical care in open xml.</P>

<P>* Larry: Had another change to the Sphymochron program that
handles the warning, Germaine has to review and run some other
data files through, then he'll provide the final version, Germaine
will post it with a user description and download instructions.</P>

<P>* Chris: Sent an email with suggested standards and desire
for access and communication about them. I would like a slot on
the agenda to talk about privacy requirements and I need at least
a one-week notice. Many groups are planning to use 802.11</P>

<P>Bob: Comments. 1) Discussions on mass customization and project
where you haven't done it before, don't work. 2) The diary process
must collect events like: I just came out of a coma, eat, dropped
unit in the sink. 3) Battery analysis has been a serious problem
of error, we don't have the depth of knowledge in the product
groups in the medical device industry so they are inventing their
own processes that are error prone. 4) We need to assure the accuracy
of the data provided to the doctor who is going to modify the
medication. 5) The Joomla site provides legal advice for open
source software. 6) My group at 3M wrote test scripts so that
testing didn't have to reinvent everything. 7) ARM7 appear to
have been clone from the Intel 8351, at least 30 years old. 8)
We'll need a microprocessor-controller at the source because we
can't store the data points, 25K points, so we can't eliminate
the microprocessor from the wearable local subsystem. 9) Need
to determine the outputs of the sensors, e.g. the piezo resistance
sensor might provide a milli volt signal, an impedance sensor
might be a micro volt, and larger signals are less expensive to
measure.</P>

<P>* Germaine: Miguel Revilla is coming on Thursday, 4/13 and
leaving on 4/16. He has been maintaining the Halberg Chronobiology
Center website. The Cosinor sample analysis can only analysis
290 lines, and this isn't enough for realistic data, 48x7 =336
and increase number values.</P>

<B>Gerry Werth - Minitopic on Clinical Information Systems</B></P>

<P>Minitopic - Mass Customization<BR>
The Dynamic Stability Model</P>

<P>Doctors have always thought they were doing this, but it is
very difficult to stabilize your inputs, there is no language
or taxonomy, so it is difficult to discuss.</P>

<P>If you want mass customization, you must be a factory/</P>

<P><BR>
Outline<BR>
* Industrial Revolution<BR>
* Flatter, Information-Based Organization<BR>
* Assembly Line Health Care<BR>
* Dynamic Stability - second industrial revolution<BR>
* Mass customization and ITZZ<BR>
* Return-on-Management (R-O-M tm)</P>

<P>* Industrial Revolution<BR>
(dynamic change for customization)<BR>
- Craft Shop ; <BR>
-- Invention; made for each customer and customized.</P>

<P>* Mass production: <BR>
(stable change for standardization)<BR>
stabilize the product, same product for a large market.<BR>
- Factory<BR>
- Synergy between craft shop &amp; factory. Invention isn't done
in the factory. Factory roles are divided between workers and
managers.</P>

<P>Flatter, Information-Based Organizations<BR>
* In 1988, Peter Drucker described three organizations; the hospital,
the university, the symphony orchestra.<BR>
- Info-based organization: knowledge will be primarily at the
bottom, int minds of the specialists.<BR>
- In each specialty, there is a head person wh9o is a working
specialist rather than a full-time manager.</P>

<P>Assembly Line Health Care<BR>
* Patient is personal, while the providers are impersonal. Each
patient has different risk taking profiles, even if they have
the same illness, they would want different treatments.</P>

<P>* Continuous Improvement<BR>
(Improve Process for stable product) <BR>
- ended with the demo product.<BR>
(Keep the product the same, improve the process).<BR>
-- team.</P>

<P>* Mass Customization<BR>
(custom product using stable process) <BR>
- Network Hub and Web</P>

<P>Dynamic stability: Network &lt;-&gt; Team. <BR>
- If you rotate a team you get a network. <BR>
- produce as network, create as team.</P>

<P>Mass Customization and IT<BR>
* Mass Customization (definition) <BR>
-- The use of loosely coupled networks of modular, flexible processing
units that apply reproducible, low-cost, high-quality processes
to create unique product value as perceived by each customer.
<BR>
* True Network Organizations require: <BR>
- Communication among workers and with customers<BR>
- Communicate across Time: follow-up<BR>
- Coordination of Activities and Responsibilities<BR>
* Modern IT enables Mass Customization<BR>
- Internet Communications Technologies<BR>
- Object-Oriented Software's Self-Managing Objects</P>

<P>Return-on-Management (tm) (R-O-M tm)<BR>
* A dollar spent on management does not directly produce goods
and s3ervice for sale.<BR>
* R-O-M (tm) = Management Value-added /Management Costs.<BR>
(Strassmann PA, 1990, The Business Value of Computers, pp85 &amp;
140.)<BR>
Of companies ranked by <BR>
R0OP-M, only those in the top 20% &quot;Spend more of their total
information technol9ogy on mission critical Operations systems
than on Management information systems. This shows that information
technology should apply where it has a direct and favorable effect
on the generation of revenues.&quot;<BR>
* Health Care: invest information technology to support Mass Customization
of clinical services.</P>

[PROCESS, MODEL, CENTRAL ISSUE] <BR>
* Invention - craft shop - Dynamic change for customization<BR>
* Mass customization - Network Hub and Spoke - Custom product
using stable Process<BR>
* Mass Production - Factory - Stable Change for Standardization<BR>
* Continuous Improvement - Team - Improve process for stable product</P>
