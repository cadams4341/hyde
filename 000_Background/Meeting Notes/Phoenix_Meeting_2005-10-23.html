<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>We will not meet on 11/27, the week of Thanksgiving.</P>

<P>Chris: Looking at software prototyping tools, eg. Eclipse,
Netbeans.</P>

<P>Bob: Showed a simple prototype of a self-power for a wearable
system, voltage = inductance * rate of change in the magnetic
field, with a diode and LED. Just shake it to charge it and it
lights a diode, stored in a capacitor. Also, John discussed a
Piezo power system. He attended a workshop on experience-based
medicine, issues were highlighting the words, efficiency, efficacy,
to attract funding. EBM, evidence based medicine, is killing off
medicine because only they will become candidates for funding.</P>

<P>Dave: Looked at Labview on sensor based for rapid prototyping
environment, emulate our system. He is meeting with Jim Holte,
talked with Mary Jo, she is working on another board. He is meeting
with her on Tuesday, doing a course project on the Piezo sensors,
looking at temporal correlations with Germaine. Dave's board works,
Mary Jo is working on a board and Dan is working on a board. We
need two working boards for flow measurements.</P>

<P>John: Posted a webpage that describes the motion sensor project.
Working with Mat Balow, selected the software to modify the sampling
rate and test the memory depth. It works on 3 volts at 0.5 ma
plus the board, based on the sampling rate.</P>

<P>Gerry: converting his presentations to Open Office for medical
references for an EMR, latest article by Kip Sullivan in Oct 2005
issue of Minnesota Physician suggests that there isn't a strong
case for the EMR.</P>

<P>Germaine - <A HREF="../../Phoenix_Bibliography.htm#anchor19202">Data
Analysis</A>, Slides. 41-62.<BR>
After Germaine presents the first pass through this presentation,
we'll take another pass and so on until we all have a good understandingh
of this material. Bob suggested that he would like to present
the second pass to test his understanding. <BR>
Germaine presented the Hyperbaric index, theory, calculation and
application to timing medication.</P>

<P>Gerry: Clinical Information Systems:<BR>
- Slack's First Law of Medical Informatics, Werner Slack, Beth
Israel Hospital in Boston MA.<BR>
-- Granularity of information.<BR>
-- Informatics: Computer hardware + software + data + information.<BR>
-- Clinician Computing: <BR>
--- Direct patient-center4ed use of information technology by
a clinican as part of clinical work flow.<BR>
-- Direct use by a clinican in clinical process: <BR>
--- direct support for clniucal workflow<BR>
--- mass customization of clinical care<BR>
--- coordination among clinicians.</P>

<P>- First Law of clinical informatics<BR>
&quot;You can take a clinical comoput8ing system and get all the
business information you want form it. But, you cannot take a
business computing system and make it clinically useful.&quot;
Warner Slack MD.</P>

<P>- Why?<BR>
-- Granualrity of clinical information<BR>
-- Non-conservation of clinical information.</P>

<P>- Non-conservation of clinical information.<BR>
-- Many details, select 10% for considerratoin as important for
the clinician's mind.<BR>
-- Chart Note: 10%<BR>
-- Coded Billing Form: 10%</P>

<P>So, of the information available, only 1,000 to 1 is retained
for analysis. Actually, it is probably closer to 1,000,000 to
1.</P>
