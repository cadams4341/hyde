<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>We decided to use the partial <A HREF="../../sitemap.html">site
map</A> which just shows the first occurrence of each html document,
but presents a simpler perspective of our site to the viewer than
the full site map which displays with every html link. There was
an interest in a table of contents. We explained that the sitemap
is a table of contents with the members of each hierarchy level
alphabetized. Germaine suggested that we provide a search function
as well. El plans to implement that capability.</P>

<P>We reviewed the &quot;<A HREF="../Phoenix_About_Our_Logo.htm">About
Our Logo</A>&quot; page provided by Germaine. Wade pointed out
that individual data doesn't even match the curve shown in the
graph, Germaine noted that the <A HREF="../Phoenix_About_Our_Logo.htm#anchor63987">graph</A>
is an idealized picture showing the major week, day and subday
cycles that comprise a typical blood pressure cycle, and individuals'
cycles will differ. We highlighted that the weekly blood pressure
graph identifies the &quot;question&quot; and need to obtain this
information and is not presented as the &quot;answer&quot;. We
clarified that the Phoenix Project is needed to help answer the
question of what is normal blood pressure variation and how abnormal
variation can be used in diagnosis and treatment. We reviewed
the overall activity shown in the <A HREF="../Phoenix_Objectives.htm">Objectives</A>
webpage under &quot;About Phoenix&quot; of which the Phoenix Project
is the first of three phases: Phoenix Project, Phoenix Measurement
Program, Phoenix Clinical Program. The Phoenix Project provides
the monitor; the Phoenix Measurement Program encourages its use
in the determination of normal blood pressure variation and which
the ailments are identified by abnormal variation; and the Phoenix
Clinical Program encourages the use of the monitor and this information
in diagnosis, prevention and treatment.</P>

<P>Germaine reviewed her <A HREF="../../011_Data_Analysis_Methods/Phoenix_Data_Analysis_Methods.htm">Data
Analysis Methods</A> project, and its subproject page is now posted
on the website. She needs volunteers to assist. Neil Clark was
interested.</P>

<P>Wade showed us his <A HREF="../../009_Impedance_Plethysmograph_Sensor/Phoenix_Plethysmograph.htm">Impedance
Plethysmograph Sensor</A> project, showed the use of electrode
tape, and aluminum foil and diaper rash ointment which includes
zinc oxide to create a good non-toxic electrical contact.</P>

<P>Germaine showed us a journal reference that 'Arterial blood
pressure was obtained noninvasively via a photoplethysmographic
transducer (JENTOW 7700: Colin Corporation, Komaki, Japan) and
continuously recorded.' Wade said that he will investigate it.</P>

<P>Wade showed us how he uses the US Patent and Trademark Office
website (<A HREF="http://www.uspto.gov/">www.uspto.gov</A>) to
investigate a technology, identify the relevant patents and determine
what to use and how to modify it to avoid violating the patent.</P>

<P>Bob Schlentz noted that impressions he had developed. A neurologist
brought up the issue of other rhythms, 1 day cycle, medicines
given to people e.g. Alzheimer's, four medicines used but they
don't work. Applying this to our blood pressure monitor, we'll
need to test it rigorously to assure that it is useful, it may
be necessary to measure more than blood pressure, and determine
necessary sample size, (e.g. To distinguish to 1% may require
10,000 measurements. Regarding to the measurement supplied, many
patients stop in the measurement program, many stop after one
interval because it doesn't provide enough incentive for the patient
to continue. They may need to see the measurements. We need to
satisfy regional regulatory medical device requirements (QSR Quality
Systems Requirements) and determine that there aren't any long
term effects. Bob also looked at blood pressure monitors at Walgreen's
and discovered that the majority of them use 2 AA cells, and the
price range was 50 and 110 based on number of buttons they had.
Regarding measuring the mechanical motions and impedance and reflection
of light, there are another set of electrodes that use capacitance
and don't touch the skin, others use Mylar and not latex for which
some people allergic or they have unknown substances.</P>

<P>Wade discussed the relationship between sonic velocity and
blood pressure. Neil questioned this capability, based on the
incompressibility of liquids, Wade explained and said he'd show
how it worked and many patents are based on it.</P>

<P>Our next meeting is July 18.</P>
