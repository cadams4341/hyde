<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>* Larry: Has been looking for references on chronobiology that
are suitable for non-technical people. Been working with testing
in visual basic framework. Needs a source control framework and
would like Dennis Lienke's advice. El will ask Dennis.</P>

<P>We discussed the issue of a quality system to address prototyping.
Larry thought that Grand Avenue Software may have opinions about
this. El said that Norm Bayne recommended a quality system but
El wanted to explore the option of no QS for prototyping to minimize
the overhead for prototyping as an idea generating and exploration
process and then ask the local FDA device contact for hif suggestions.
<BR>
Bob suggested that we need is a document that describes what goes
in and goes out, a &quot;goes-into-and-goes-out-of&quot; document.
Larry suggested that we refer to it as a high level functional
requirements or description - Inputs and outputs. <BR>
* Chris: Is working on his version of the Data Analysis Methods
as a high level function description, the mathematics, the architecture,
terminology, and glossary.<BR>
* DeWayne said that the most difficult part has been getting the
inexpensive hardware. We need to provide the hardware. <BR>
* Dave Skramsted: Has taken an employment position, has passed
leadership of the Sensor Team to Carl Schu, while he begins his
new job, then he plans to return to the sensor team as an active
participant.</P>

<P>Paradigm Professions<BR>
What's Special about Paradigm Professions<BR>
* Clergy + Laws + Medicine<BR>
* Fiduciary:= Involving or Inspiring Trust.<BR>
* Confidential Relationship.<BR>
* Putting Clients' Interest above Self Interest.<BR>
* Spiritual Confession.<BR>
* Lawyer-Client Privilege.<BR>
* Doctor-Patient Privilege.</P>

<P>What is Special about Medicine?<BR>
* Doctor-Patient Privilege: confidentiality<BR>
* Life-and-Death Issues<BR>
* Quality-of-Life Issues<BR>
* Trust: Therapeutic Rapport.</P>

<P>Discussion Question: Is Medicine Different from Auto Repair?</P>

<P>* El: Life is so important that we expect our community/gov't
to provide rules/laws to require and encourage a physician to
support our health needs above all other interests. Interestingly,
payment for auto repair is usually outcome-based while medicine
is typically not. <BR>
* Chris: We expect our physicians to have behaviors that reinforce:
legal, economic, quality. We can't have these relationships with
an auto mechanic. <BR>
* Bob: In auto repair, the car is often at &quot;terminus&quot;,
while for the patient, it is either worse or better, usually worse.
Autos are static and simpler, while patients are dynamic and complex.
<BR>
* Gerry: Coming from engineering into medicine, I thought there
was a difference. The competency domains are different. My engineering
competency didn't carry over. So I was interested in what kind
of evolutionary prototypes would work, provide a working prototype,
help us discover our requirements, and address the unpredictability
of medicine.<BR>
