<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P><B>Status Review:</B></P>

<P>* Dave Skramsted: Went through the reading notes, using SciLab.
Now, I'm building the sensor.</P>

<P>* Larry Beatty: Finished changes to the Sphygmochron application.
Germaine found the source for an older least squares Fortran program,
using the Watcom and DotNet Fortran complier. Version 2 is the
existing program, Version 3, does everything that is shown in
the Data Analysis Methods Powerpoint Version 2 doesn't compute
fractionated excess, just global excess. Germaine will handle
the webpage, describing how to use Sphygmochron version 2. Beyond
the original 3 changes, we changed some of the charting, worked
around the restriction of contiguous data, and other things that
seemed useful and Germaine wanted.</P>

<P>* Chris Adams: Regarding the Sphygmochron prototype that will
be posted on the website, we would like to gather requirements:
specifically, 1) what do you want, 2) are the inputs to this all
of the inputs that they would want, and the outputs all that they
would want. (Germaine: a few answers would be that we want data
overtop of the Sphygmochron: 1) information about the patient,
their symptoms, gender, age. 2) The input file must be prepared,
and it would be nice to not have to prepare it. 3) We get data
from several hundred subjects, comparison of two drugs, effect
of weight loss, dietary intervention; and we wouldn't use this
program. We would like common data to be repeated without the
data entry person having to enter it.</P>

<P>* Gerry: arranging to work with Dr. Vergil Slee.</P>

<P>* Chris: completed the assessment of privacy requirements.
Wants to present them. Will present next time in 30 minutes. Responded
to an interesting abstract Franz provided, about the device used
in a telemedicine using internet resources. This could lead to
additional requirements. We may want it to connect to another
device, a 3rd party workstation. We should be prepared for networking
the device, leading to privacy issues and security. Our current
model is the medical information bus, a multilayered stack. Wants
to know the next needs: 1) process engineering - project infrastructure
- to leverage the graduate students - 2-3 month jobs, specifying
application requirements for device, security requirements, eliciting
analysis and workstation requirements for the prototype. So, next
week, he would like: 1) 30 minutes to present privacy requirements,
2) future direction, and 3) access to the standards documents.</P>

<P>* Norm Bayne. He has become familiar with web page management
and placed his outline of the quality system. Also, he met with
a contact with an FDA accelerator, to help customers get through
FDA compliance quickly. His needs are to find people to work on
the quality system.</P>

<P>* Chris Fuller: talked with a field engineer for piezio film
products at Specialty Products and got access to the project lab.
Regarding sensor meetings, Chris is available to meet after the
Phoenix meeting on Sundays, and Dave can meet weekday evenings
and weekend afternoons. Chris is using the Eagle CAD application
to do design, so that he isn't tied to a specific board manufacturers
product.</P>

<P>* Bob: Attended a conference on diagnostic imaging and software
problems. They want to sell their ideas to companies, but they
are finding that companies don't want to use open source software
because they feel that they will lose proprietary pricing premiums.
However, FDA wants open requirements and full disclosure.</P>

<P>* Germaine: Met with Miguel Revilla. He said that Java may
be appropriate because of security compliance, and he brought
his supercomputer Fortran source code. Additionally, the Halberg
Center received more data from the site in India where we had
a problem. The data came in two files because the person was monitoring
for more time than the program would hold (Sph ver 2), and they
couldn't easily combine the two files into one. (Larry said it
might be due to an impeded control Z, used by Dos for End of File.
He said he could modify the Ver 3 application accommodate it.

<B>Gerry Werth - Minitopic on Clinical Information Systems</B></P>

<P><B>Entity Codes- Capturing Clinical Detail</B></P>

<P>When you go from a specific set of clinical data to a class
of data, specific detail is lost.</P>

<P><I>Reference: Partnerships, Health Commons Institute, Fall
2003, pp 7-8.</I></P>

<P>Entity Codes: Capturing Clinical Detail - Outline</P>

<P>Goals: Capturing exact diagnosis<BR>
* Step 1: Input<BR>
- FV Dx: Free Vocabulary Diagnosis<BR>
* Step 2: Standardization<BR>
- FV Code<BR>
- CV Dx: Controlled Vocabulary Disagnosis<BR>
- Entity Code<BR>
* Step 3 : Coding<BR>
- Classification: ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, other.<BR>
* Glossary</P>

<P>Goals for Diagnosis Entry<BR>
Capture Physician's Exact Clinical Diagnosis<BR>
* Physician input must be barrier free<BR>
- Must accept the physician's own words.<BR>
* Must retain the exact language of phyusic8ian<BR>
* Must also retain the preferred, standardized term forr the diagnosis.<BR>
* Diagnosis must be coded to the appropriate classsific8iations
(e.g. ICD-9-CM)</P>

<P>Step 1: Input<BR>
Capture the Original Diagnosis<BR>
* Coder finds Free Vocabulary Diagnosis<BR>
(FV Dx) in the medical record</P>

<P>Step 2: Standardization<BR>
Map to Controlled Vocabulary<BR>
* f New <BR>
Secretariat Maps FV Dx to Controlled vocabulary (CV)</P>

<P>Step 3: Coding <BR>
Code to ICD-9-CM<BR>
(e.g. incidences of West Nile are lumped with others. If you give
people an ill structured process, they will structure it but everyone
will structure it differently. Reliability will vary unpredictably.)<BR>
* System uses Entity Code:<BR>
- IDC-9-CM<BR>
- ICD-10-CM</P>

<P>Glossary<BR>
* Dx: Diagnosis<BR>
* FV: free vocabulary<BR>
* FC Dx: original diagnosis verbatim.<BR>
* FV Code: An accession number assigned to each Free Vocabulary
Diagnosis.<BR>
* FV Database: A list off Free Vocabulary diagns9oses used by
physicians, complied from actual usage, and their codes.<BR>
* CV: Controlled Vocabulary: A set of preferred terms used to
standardize terminology within a field or profession - e.g. SNOMED0-CT.<BR>
* CV Dx: The standard, preferred term for a given diagnosis.<BR>
* Entity Code: Diagnosis Entity <BR>
* Code: A permanent, unalterable code assigned to each diagnostic
term in the Controlled Vocabulary.<BR>
* Secretariat: A permanent facility which maintains the FV Database
mapped to the CV database and provides coders, in real time, FV
codes and cor3espoinding CV Diagnoses and Entity Codes for new
terminology.</P>

<P>Currently, there are only controlled vocabularies, driven by
either the clinicians or the billing agencies.</P>

<P>Originally, ICD was developed by pathologists and usurped by
billing agencies. It is an international classification, managed
by World Health Organization. In the US, the CM, HC, the generic
term is called cross-walking to map one set of codes to another.
Almost all are cross-walked to DSM then into HC (healthcare codes).
This is a large bureaucratic process.</P>

<P>The current process starts at Step 3. (ICD for diagnosis, and
CPT for treatment) so that it gets paid for.</P>

<P>Q&amp;A: <BR>
* How has this proposal been accepted? He'll find out next week.<BR>
* How do we apply this to ambulatory blood pressure monitors?
At least use the FV.<BR>
* What are cardiologists doing with blood pressure?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Bob Schlentz: Data Analysis Methods Review</B></P>

<P>* Bob has created two sine waves, one with a period of 180
units of time, second with a 90 units time period, summed them,
and applied the Sphygmochron algorithm. He'll use the second as
a measure of noise, and change it from a deterministic source
to a random source and see how the solutions behave. He needs
the Excel techniques for finding a matrix inverse and performing
matrix computations . El will email him the process and an example.
He will continue next week. <BR>
