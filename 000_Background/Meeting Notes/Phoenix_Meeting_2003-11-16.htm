  <P>El: Seems to want to measure blood pressure with no more expense
  than with standard cuff, just as easy, collect week of measurements,
  unobtrusive. <BR>
<BR>
  Bob: Pressure cuff hurts if you are large or have edema. If the
  blood flow is blocked, it only measures the force of the device.
  Arterial pressure is different from venous. There is need to
  measure pressure at different parts of body. Wants a way to keep
  notes on what is happening. Many doctors don't know what to do
  with the data, e.g. cardiologists want EKGs. <BR>
<BR>
  Jim: How to sense blood pressure other than by cuff? <BR>
<BR>
  Initially, we need to be open endedCurt: about learning their
  requirements and what is available, then focus in on projects
  &amp; tasks, breaking up into subgroups. Everyone share their
  perspective/comments/questions via emails to the group by &quot;reply
  all&quot; until we get an email list server. Send a list of our
  questions to Franz &amp; Germaine before the meeting. Can park
  in the Mayo Ramp but it is often full. Best parking is on River
  Road. <BR>
<BR>
  Plan for 11/20/2003 at the Halberg Chronobiology Center <BR>
<BR>
  Would like to: 1) ask Franz tell us about the background of his
  needs for blood pressure measurement, 2) see the current blood
  pressure measurement device and hear what they like about it
  and what they don't like about it, 3) ask further questions.
  Timeframe: 1-3 hours.<BR>
<BR>
  Follow-on meeting: Sunday 12/7, 2:30p at North Pointe Restaurant
  (same location as 11/16)<BR>
