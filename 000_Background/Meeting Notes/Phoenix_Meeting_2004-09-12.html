<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>Dennis brings extensive software and systems experiences, especially
in Linux. He wanted to know our software requirements and suggested
that the sensors needed to be working before the software was
useful. Wade suggested that we could describe the initial requirements
now so that the software effort could be begun now. We have three
types of sensors will that provide the same type of data, we need
a simpler less costly interface than USB for example, like a flash
card, able to accomplish this &quot;for a bushel of yams&quot;.</P>

<P>Shawn asked if we were willing to have an intermediate goal
of something that does this without worrying about the cost, size
or difficulty of using, in order to collect lots of data, e.g.
a development system. Wade says we'll be collecting lots of data
and sifting through it to learn how to analyze it effectively.
Shawn suggested looking at the RabbitCore, at www.rabbitsemiconductor.com
, their next generation of semiconductors, plugs onto system boards,
and offload data at real-time. Wade said he was most worried about
power thus cost, Shawn said he would be most worried about calibration,
the rest follows from that. Wade said battery is a cost and weight
problem, but said the key technical problem is calibration, there
is nothing new in wave front technology, a number of the patents
have expired, the basic technology is open for general use. Shawn
asked if it could measure systolic and diastolic. Wade said Chen
had developed one. Shawn said the world needs a new blood pressure
monitor.</P>

<P>Bob asked Germaine if she had a battery for the Collins System,
for the first set of equipment for Dr. Watanabe, who attended
the last meeting. Germaine said she would have it ready by or
she can bring it next time. She has the old battery, which will
be available anytime Bob comes to the lab, for example, by Monday.</P>

<P>Bob asked who is the &quot;customer&quot;, the Halberg Chronobiology
Center only, or/and cardiologists, or/and fitness people. Also,
where are they geographically and what is their access to money
to acquire it. E.g. if we had the product now, who would use it,
where, and how. Germaine wanted to know how they could be mutually
exclusive, Bob said that each may require a different kind of
display, and their requirements are different. Germaine said it
was for the &quot;person in the streets&quot;, for someone who
doesn't have special equipment.</P>

<P>Bob asked, is it the consensus of the group that the sphygmomanometer
&quot;cuff&quot; be only used for calibration and not for ongoing
blood pressure measurement. Wade said that we would use it only
for calibration, we need it so that Phoenix monitor produces measurements
that are comparable to the cuff monitor. Bob asked if we needed
a white paper to establish its accuracy.</P>

<P>Bob said there was another company built a monitor with an
ARM 7 processor, does all dsp and data storage with it, and they
can communicate with a PC for further analysis, the length of
monitoring is dependent on battery,published in EE Times.</P>

<P>Bob mentioned that the package is important, a UK company Electroplaster
Company, has the form of chunk of putty on the arm, like a bandage.</P>

<P>Bob said we choose to measure at the brachial artery, is this
up, down, what are they doing. Other areas include: subclavial
artery, under the chin, external carotid, femoral artery - new
type of underwear.</P>

<P>These are our goals for the next meeting:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Wade - set of goals
  <LI>Germaine - next meeting will have one example of real data
  and how it is analyzed.
  <LI>Dennis - wants a list of requirements, doing some recruiting.
  <LI>El - presented a draft product introduction system, the heart
  of the quality system. Next time he expects to have a version
  to review in preparation for placing it on our website.
  <LI>Germaine - we should identify data analysis projects, specific
  problems to solve.
</UL>

<P>Activities for our next meeting: 1) develop software requirements,
and 2) discuss Bob's 7 problems: battery, user, sphygmomanometer,
other measurements, competitors (using ARM 7) is all of the electronics
work done, power, packaging. <BR>
