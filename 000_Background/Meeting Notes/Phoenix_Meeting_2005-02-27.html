Discussion</H3>

<P>Max Cortner, Director of Production Testing for Guidant, joined
us and gave us a presentation on medical device testing, which
is posted on our <A HREF="../../Phoenix_Bibliography.htm#anchor2131">Bibliography
page</A> and directly at <A HREF="../../0001_Bibliography/Testing%20Medical%20Devices.ppt">Testing
Medical Devices.ppt.</A></P>

<P>We described our interests before Max began his presentation.</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Bob: How do we test that our device causes no adverse reactions?
  <LI>Chris: What is the scope of the test activity, how much of
  what they do do they do because they are required by the partners
  vs how much do they need to do?
  <LI>Germaine: How does a measure from a device change over time?
  <LI>Dan: Is there a way to do acceleration testing?
  <LI>Mary Jo: How do we calibrate?
  <LI>Dennis: Interested in software.
  <LI>Mike: Regulatory rules for testing.
  <LI>John: Without a device spec, or ISO 9000, is tthere a possibility.
  <LI>Larry: How does an organization like us get through testing.
  <LI>Wade: Regarding the federal regulations, how does the design
  history file work?
</UL>

<P>Max: I did frame this discusion around the federal rules. They
can be gotten from the web, but it isn't easy. 21CFR Part 28,
and 21CFR Part820 refers to the quality system, and ISO 13485
is similar. You'll be dealing with rules put out by the CDRH,
the Center for Devices and Radiology Health. FDA certifies safety
and CDRH certifies efficacy.</P>

<P>What have you done to show that your device can't hurt anyone,
and that you understand the risk and have done something about
it? The second is more difficult. The Quality System includes
design control for Class II devices: planning, input, output,
review; design verification, design validation, design transfer
to manufacturing, design change procedure, design history file
- documents to show the design complies.</P>

<P>The design history file shows the history and it documents
that all of these things happened. In some cases, it is a metal
file case. It is not a static thing but shows what went on in
the design meetings. For the plan for the design, it should include
the plan which includes people, resources, processes, etc. The
FDA will demand to look at it, but it keeps it as private.</P>

<P>El: We have a plan and a quality system, and minutes of every
meeting are posted on the website, and the website has been archived
every week. We need to put it in the form that constitutes a design
history file and implement a signature method for all changes.
(showed it to Max).</P>

<P>Max: That looks good. You'll need to put it in a form so that
it can be easily audited and assure that every modification is
signed. A simple password is sufficient, or digital signature.</P>

<P>Then, he reviewed typical design verification. Clinical use
is validation, but design is verification. Verification shows
that the design does what you claimed it does. Validation shows
the design conforms to user needs and intended use. FDA wants
plans and prospective data, e.g. what you expect. Never change
the data. Just redo the test. Show them the failing results as
well or they get suspicious. When the data changes, show them
the change in the system.</P>

<P>Chris: Is validation inherently a system level test?<BR>
Max: Yes. That is a great way to describe it. Six sigma is not
part of FDA approval. <BR>
Bob: What if you have a device that uses Microsoft Windows? What
do you do to validate Windows?<BR>
Max: There is a process for using Off-the-Shelf software. However,
you do need to show what you expect from it. You are expected
to do some testing to show that it works. For example, you can
show that your data is always of this format, and it always produces
data with this format. Because you are providing diagnostic data,
it is not as risky as therapeutic data.</P>

<P>A typical design validation includes external interface specs
and simulated use.</P>

<P>He discussed Risk Analysis and Hazard Analysis. FMEA is part
of risk analysis. What are the risks and how will you mitigate
them? Hazards are ranked by number based on their probability
of occurring and their impact to health. 4 is higher risk and
1 is low risk. FMECA includes both risk and hazard analysis. FDA
will want to know if there are any 3 or 4 hazards and what have
we done to mitigate them. You'll submit it as a Class 2 device
and they'll reply as to whether is it, and in all likelihood they'll
say it is a Class 2 device.</P>

<P>They'll want to see that you have tested with non-experts users.
An example would be someone who is not on the design team. You
should also include someone who doesn't like the software. For
example, checkout engineers can be classified as engineers who
didn't write the code.</P>

<P>Asking a design engineer will typically provide a 60-70 % coverage
test by showing that it works. A test engineer will try to break
it and will provide a very high coverage test.</P>

<P>Also, the requirements have a preamble that says companies
can tailor the test to their means, so that the cost of testing
can be scaled to the cost of the item.</P>

<P>FDA will want safety and efficacy.</P>

<P>Proving Safety means providing a statistically significant
number of people for a statistically significant amount of time.
You'll want to say that it is as good as a blood pressure cuff.</P>

<P>Be very careful how you advertise your device to the general
public for sale. Selling means taking money for your device. Do
not advertise it for sale unless you have had a clinical trial.
Are you really promoting the device? You want an IDE -- investigational
device exemption -- which is an FDA exemption for trials. Propose
an IDE case, they'll enable you to give it, for example, to the
following clinics over the following time period following this
plan.</P>

<P>El: We may want to think of how Germaine would describe it
to a colleague to encourage them to use it, identify the claims
and develop a test to show that it meets them. <BR>
Max: That's exactly what you should do. Identify the claims and
build your testing around them.</P>

<P>Engineering analysis includes identifying potential risks,
hazards and mitigation, FMEA, and biocompatibility analysis of
materials.</P>

<P>Proving efficacy: This means identifying that it meets intended
use, claims&quot; labeling, and that it is true.</P>

<P>Design History File: All have documents around them have version
control and history on all. They include requirements, its peer
revew, design details, design verification, design validation,
V&amp;V report, and its peer review. Design details are anything
needed to reproduce the item.</P>

<P>Under QSR, you must segregate the prototypes from the items
for sale or use.</P>

<P>Under auditing, you are permitted some number of hours to recover
it. You can have it in a Mentor Graphics file, you can bring it
up without having to go back to the original paper copy.</P>

<P>Code inspection is listed as one of the approved methods of
drawing the conclusion you did. Is the criteria clear using an
inspection? You need to be careful with observational data. You
need clear criteria so that you can show that you meet them. For
code reviews, you need a coding standard.</P>

<P>For this system, you'll want a simple test procedure, with
observational criteria and data.</P>

<P>Test plan: You'll need calibrated equipment - it's a big thing.
Manually recorded data is fine, but you'll need to have it like
a lab notebook, so you have the original written data, as long
as it is indelible, dated and signed. They like to see a description
in the plan, with a little schematic, and scenario descriptions.</P>

<P>Wade: How do you handle engineering changes?<BR>
Max: Use the ECO process, e.g. Schematic 1, Schematic 2, and the
changes between them. You need to be able to show the content,
makeup, e.g. Rev B, version 6 of software, version 3 of schematic,
point to the elements, and know what it is. The other view is
the stack of documents and the rev history of each, after the
first base line. As we are doing prototypes to define our design
and then producing a design spec, that becomes your baseline,
and you don't have to worry about what came before. Regarding
software test, define it by blocks and do block by block testing.</P>

<P>Chris: Should we be doing system engineering?<BR>
Max: My recommendation is yes, for auditing. <BR>
Wade: We actually have been doing systems engineering, but just
haven't been calling it that. <BR>
Chris: In the medical device industry, who ever got done first
became the system engineers. <BR>
Max: 10 years ago, they were the 'fellows' of the organization.</P>

<P>Max gave us a copy of the FDA's &quot;General Principles of
Software Validation&quot;. We posted a link to it from our <A
HREF="../../012_Regulatory_Approval/Phoenix_Regulatory_Approval_Requirements.html#anchor141997">Regulatory
Approval/Requirements page</A>. He will return and give us another
presentation that more focused on design testing, tentatively
on April 10th.</P>
