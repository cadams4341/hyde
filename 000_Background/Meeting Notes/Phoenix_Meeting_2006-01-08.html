<H3>Discussion</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>Vince Pham and Dewayne Hillman joined us. Germaine discussed
  ambulatory blood pressure monitors, what the Halberg Chronobiology
  Center needs.
  <LI>Larry has been investigating application software from Freescale
  and Microchip, to simulate a uP and its attached devices, to
  use for either extreme programming or agile software.  We need
  to run tests on code in development.  We want a simulator that
  is free, satisfies our needs and run several hundred tests per
  minute. 
  <LI>Dave has been working in our Phoenix lab on our sensor technologies
  and working with our team.  Mary Jo is working on piezo film
  prototype.  He met with some canndidates this week and will meet
  wth Vince after the meeting.
  <LI>Bob is working on the calibration project, is looking for
  techniques that do not require surgery, and sent an email assessment
  of the latest copy opf the
  <LI>Gerry: Looked at Open Document standard for exchanging information,
  and continuing to look at clinical information systems issues.
  He is looking at the issues around digital patient records, possibly
  that it takes longer and may increase patient risk. 
  <LI>Dennis is working on a friendly version of version control
  and set up a wiki, and help the Halberg center set up a computer
  for BBS and version control. Larry found a facility, SourceForge
  which supports SubVersion for source code version control.  Dennis
  found a facility, Wikipedia\Books for a free wiki.  
  <LI>Germaine discussed the Sphygmochron program, demonstrated
  it, we created a zip, Larry Beatty will work on it.  Bob Schlentz
  suggested that we start a design record (e.g. digital notebook),
  that notes what we started with, what change was made on what
  date and why.  It is a chronological record of all changes.

<P>Gerry presented a mini-topic on clinical information systems:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Healthcare Economics Primer.<BR>
  Vendors, consumers, stakeholders, wallets.
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>- Vendors - supply servioces aqnd products<BR>
  - Customerrs, make buying decisions, define value.<BR>
  - Consumers, define quality<BR>
  - Wallets, provvide money, impose constraints.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
  <LI>It is easier if your customers, consumers and wallets are
  the same individual.
  <LI>Three primary stakeholdeers<BR>
  - Patient, consumer<BR>
  Uses products and services, defines quality<BR>
  - Clinician, vendor<BR>
  Role of he healer, name the desease is to give power over it.<BR>
  - Purchaser, customerer &amp; wallet<BR>
  customer makes buiying decisions, defines purchase value, 
  <LI>Can there be Win-Win-Win solution?
  <LI>Physicians are dealing with the &quot;hassle&quot; factor,
  satisfaction of healing, otherwise they may quit the field.
  <LI>Insurance is a secondary stakeholder, not primary. 
  <LI>Why is healthcare system such a mess?  Because the customer,
  consumeer and wallet have no interests in common. E.g. Germs
  make you ill, 
  <LI>Gerry Werth identified an article by Peter Drucker, &quot;The
  Coming of the New Organization&quot;, HBR, 1/1/1988.  In it,
  Drucker recommends that decision makers be on the front lines,
  like cardiologist, e.g. the department chair of cardiology is
  still a cardiologist, and keeps at least 20% clinical cardiology.
  The chief is still a practioner.
