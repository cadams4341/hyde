Discussion</H2>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Steve Stadler is joining us. He has an electronics design consulting
company that focuses on embedded systems, is a member of the Twin
Cities IEEE Consulting Network and is looking forward to participating
in the Phoenix project. He'll review our material, talk with Wade,
and select a project.</P>

<P>Bob: Walgreen, Walgreens is marketing a wristmounted blood
pressure monitor for a little over $50. We found a blood pressure
monitor at:<BR>
www.walgreens.com/store/product.jhtml?id=prod396823&amp;CATID=100979&amp;skuid=sku396824&amp;navAction=jump&amp;navCount=0</P>

<P>and noted that it is an Omron self-inflating cuff, 90 measurement
memory, powered by 2 AAA batteries, targeted for home use, and
has a $89.99 price. It indicates that there is a growing consumer
market.</P>

<P>El: Designed a new hompage and tributary pages, will email
the new draft webpage to Germaine to review with Franz and return
with comments.</P>

<P>Preparation for the May 16th brunch.</P>

<P>11 Phoenix attendees have sent RSVPs to me: El &amp; Riva Nolley,
Wade Peterson, Curt McNamara, Bob &amp; Eileen Schlentz, Srilakshmi,
Srikanth, Jim Holte, Mary Jo Rawson, Jay Rabel</P>

<P>Suggested agenda</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Franz Halberg - Halberg Chronobiology Center <BR>
  Welcome for BIOCOS Project
  <LI>Phoenix Project - Phoenix Project<BR>
  Ask everyone introduce themselves and identify what they would<BR>
  like to learn<BR>
  o El Nolley - 5 min: History, objectives, and our questions <BR>
  o Jim Holte - Welcome from the University's School of engineering<BR>
  o Bob Schlentz - 5 minute talk:<BR>
  &quot;Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor - A Patient's Perspective&quot;<BR>
  o Wade Peterson - 5 minute talk: Blood Pressure Sensors
  <LI>Michael Kallok - A Perspective from the US Biomedical Device
  Industry<BR>
  (Past editor of Biomedical and Instrumentation Technology)
  <LI>A&amp;D - Mr. Hiroshi Oyama - A&amp;D's perspective and what
  they've learned<BR>
  about BP monitoring THE LONGER THE BETTER; NO NEED TO GIVE TIME
  NOW<BR>
  o What works and what doesn't.<BR>
  o Where is technology and the industry going &amp; when.
  <LI>Germaine Cornelissen, Franz Halberg &amp; El Nolley, - Conclusions
  &amp; Thank You
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>El can bring his video projector and computer. We would need
a screen and a way to slightly darken the room. <BR>
Questions: 1) Should we use the projector for presentations?,
2) Does the Hilton have wireless LAN (WIFI), or other high speed
internet access?</P>

<P>Dress: El is planning to wear a sports jacket &amp; tie. Our
guests from Japan will probably wear suits.</P>

<P>Questions:<BR>
o What have they learned about sensor approaches, what works and
what doesn't?<BR>
o Why did they stay with such a conventional approach, eg. Regular
batteries, cuff, etc?<BR>
o They have nice analysis approaches and incorporate techniques
from chronobiology. But, they do not have reference data, why
not? They are using oscillometric measurements and require algorithms
to estimate systolic and diastolic pressures that use static parameters
that have since changed? How do they intend to address this? <BR>
o How did they accomplish validation and certification?<BR>
o Are they interested in sharing of data &amp; approaches to improve
diagnosis &amp; treatment? What is their approach to incorporating
new suggested protocols and data?</P>
