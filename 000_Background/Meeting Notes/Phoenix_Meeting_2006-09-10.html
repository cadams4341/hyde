<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P><B>Status Review:</B></P>

<P>* Larry Akre joined us. <BR>
* Germaine: New papers showing how to get arterial stiffness by
measuring blood pressure using a regression between systolic and
diastolic pressure seeking the resting point, plot measurements
in diastolic-systolic pressure pairs, they form a line and calculating
stiffness=1-slope. Think it was in one of the hypertension journals,
as a set of three papers, two papers and one editorial. Chris
said it is important that Phoenix comply or establish a standard
so that our data can be used for such purposes through comparison
with other measurement sources. <BR>
* Mike: working on a conceptual model for the pulse wave flow
in the artery, so we understand what we are measuring, especially
since Franz said the diastolic is very important to get right.
Wants to understand the cuff, what it is measuring, what it means
and what is the conceptual model, and the relationship between
the restricted flow model and the unrestricted flow model. <BR>
* Gerry: Been practicing primary care, computer support for clinical
care, error reduction from automated systems in research system
isn't replicated in commercial systems, and they may induce new
errors. <BR>
* Dave: Carl did some further experimenting with LabView, some
missing data due to data dropouts, the device driver or a system
tuning issue. The Sensor Team is meeting next Sunday, 9/17, 1
p.m. in the lab, 2-110 EECS.<BR>
* Bob Schlentz: has been thinking about measuring the diastolic
blood pressure. May be able to apply the systolic blood pressure
techniques to the diastolic by filtering to locate the time at
which the diastolic occurs. Germaine suggested that it might be
easier to get the diastolic from a model. Started <BR>
* Chris: Completed papers on Privacy and HIPAA for publication,
citing Phoenix as the organization citation. In 4 weeks, hope
to have a structure for a presentation and 8 weeks the presentation
on Germaine's Data Analysis Methods. <BR>
* Larry: Final-tested program was sent to Germaine in, Sphymochron
ver 2, six weeks ago, looking for her feedback. Germaine wants
to use it on several data sets. It won't happen until after China,
9/28, the meeting after that, possibly Oct 8th. He has a couple
of questions, 1) Version Control, Sourceforge, ask Dennis, 2)
for the Quality System for the Sphymochron SW, are we ready to
go with it. Germaine has IRB approval for data collection. Does
Phoenix need a quality system for work in this area? Grand Avenue
Avenue Software has a potential solution. <BR>

<H3>Clinical Information Mini-topic - Gerry Werth</H3>

<P>Position Coded Data<BR>
Physician shorthand Notation for Lab Results.</P>

<P>Overview<BR>
* Position Coded Data<BR>
* Position Coded Electrolytes<BR>
* Position Coded Blood Counts<BR>
* PatientKeeper: example.</P>

<P>Position-Coded Data<BR>
* Physicians use position-co9ded shorthand notation to record
olab results, Electrolytes<BR>
- Lytes / CBC / ABG<BR>
(This may be an under-researched area of user interface.) <BR>
* This shorthand is known and used frequently by all medical students
and resident physicians (at least in the US).<BR>
* There is no formal name for this notation.<BR>
* This notation is almost never used by electronic clinical record
systems.</P>

<P>Bioinformatic Issues<BR>
* This is not formally discussed.<BR>
* It carries a lot of information.<BR>
* Practitioners cannot understand it without laying it out in
this pattern. <BR>
* Why is this so useful, distinctive? <BR>
* Are there cognitive psychological characteristics of this that
should be incorporated in other bioinformatic displays?<BR>
