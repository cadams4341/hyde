<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>We reviewed the Phoenix Project for John Gould, who joined
Phoenix today.</P>

<P><BR>
We reviewed the article/press release inviting volunteers to join
Phoenix and decided where to link it to our website, specifically
on the homepage next to the &quot;Volunteers are Needed&quot;
link, on the &quot;About Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Projects&quot;
pages, and on &quot;Volunteers are Needed&quot;, so that the &quot;Volunteers
are Needed&quot; and &quot;Why Volunteer for Phoenix&quot; are
both linked to each other. This article has been submitted to
the Twin Cities IEEE to be posted on their webpage at <A HREF="http://www.tc-ieee.org/">www.tc-ieee.org</A>
.</P>

<P>Wade is investigating the Impedance Plethysmograph, p. 419-420
of the Measurement, Instrumentation and Sensors Handbook. From
it we can obtain the velocity of the pressure wave and derive
blood pressure from it. It may be a better technique than piezo
file and we want to investigate both. Therefore, Wade will investigate
starting a project to measure blood velocity using this technique.</P>

<P>Wade's questions (Q) and Bob's answers (A).<BR>
Q: What are inexpensive sources of electrodes? A: Aluminum foil
and saliva. John suggested EMI tape <BR>
Q: What are electroconductive adhesives? A: saliva, zinc oxide,
k-y-jelly, salt water in gelatin, and conductive paste used with
HP electrodes.</P>

<P>Germaine said that she will be ready to post her Data Analysis
project page soon.</P>

<P>Dates for our next three meetings are:</P>
