  <B>Discussion:</B><BR>
  Germaine: Blood pressure is typically lower at night, higher
  during day. Alteration in circadian rhythms can be indicative
  of disease. Better than mean, smaller errors, &amp; reduce other
  abnormalities. Eg. Large amplitude. Treatments include relaxation,
  medication that reduces amplitude and mean value. Time on treatment
  can affect amount required, side effects, impact on circadian
  rhythm. Two day span measurements may differ. Mesor-hypertension
  &amp; CHAT. Seven day profiles are predictive of representative
  of behavior that occurs over 50 percent of the time. It is of
  interest to identify trends - e.g. Worsening diseases. Leads
  to treatments that can depend on symptoms. Eg. Fast acting drug
  vs. slow acting drug. <BR>
<BR>
  Indirect measurements require time &amp; direct measurements
  are instantaneous. 4/dy is minimal, 24/dy is adequate, 48/dy
  is better. <BR>
<BR>
  In future include: Jim Holte, Earl Bakken, Brian Brockway. <BR>
<BR>
  Chris: There are implantable devices. How expensive?<BR>
<BR>
  Franz: Like a pen, would be good. Current devices are way too
  expensive. And as easy to use as current.<BR>
