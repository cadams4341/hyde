  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In February 12, 2002, Franz Halberg
  and Germaine Cornelissen gave a presentation on Chronobiology
  to the Twin Cities IEEE Systems Dynamics Study Group </FONT><A
  HREF="http://www.sdyn.tc-ieee.org/">www.sdyn.tc-ieee.org</A><FONT
   COLOR="#000000">. They claimed that the values for &quot;normal&quot;
  medical measurements were not static but cycled over regular
  time periods. It was a fascinating presentation that ranged from
  showing experimental data and models of typical daily cycles
  in blood pressure to yearly and multiyear cycles in body weight
  and blood chemistry. Franz speculated that even normal values
  for societal ethics may cycle over time.</FONT></P>
  <P>During the discussion that followed their presentation, he
  asked if we, as electrical engineers, would develop a blood pressure
  monitor that would collect a week of blood pressure measurements.
  A group led by Curt McNamara agreed to do this.</P>
  <P>Over the next 18 months they met. On September 30 2003, when
  Curt McNamara and El Nolley were working on a systems dynamical
  model and El mentioned that he wanted to get more experience
  with the medical technology marketplace, Curt asked if El would
  lead the blood pressure group, and suggested that they call it
  the Phoenix Project. Over the next two months, El contacted people
  who had participated or expressed interest.</P>
  <P>We scheduled an initial planning meeting on <A HREF="Meeting%20Notes/Phoenix_Meeting_2003-11-16.htm">November
  16, 2003</A> and a follow-on meeting on <A HREF="Meeting%20Notes/Phoenix_Meeting_2003-11-20.htm">November
  20, 2003</A> with our 'customer' Franz Halberg and Germaine Cornelissen
  at the <A HREF="http://www.msi.umn.edu/~halberg/">Halberg Chronobiology
  Center</A> to learn about their needs.</P>
  <P>Next, we met on <A HREF="Meeting%20Notes/Phoenix_Meeting_2003-12-07.htm">12/7
  </A>and 12/24 to discuss needs and product requirements. On <A
  HREF="Meeting%20Notes/Phoenix_Meeting_2004-01-11.htm">1/11/2004</A>
  and <A HREF="Meeting%20Notes/Phoenix_Meeting_2004-01-25.htm">1/25</A>
  Curt led us through a mind-map exercise to encompass possible
  issues, approaches and hot topics. On 1/25 Wade Peterson introduced
  us to Open Source as a way to deal with the cost of intellectual
  property. On 2/8 and <A HREF="Meeting%20Notes/Phoenix_Meeting_2004-02-22.htm">2/22</A>,
  we discussed different technologies and design approaches.</P>
  <P>On <A HREF="Meeting%20Notes/Phoenix_Meeting_2004-03-07.htm">3/7</A>
  Wade presented a detailed project description using piezo film
  and asked for help pursuing it. On <A HREF="Meeting%20Notes/Phoenix_Meeting_2004-03-21.htm">3/21</A>
  Wade presented a temporary website and discussed progress on
  two projects. By <A HREF="Meeting%20Notes/Phoenix_Meeting_2004-04-04.htm">4/4</A>
  El had migrated it to a permanent website at <A HREF="http://www.phoenix.tc-ieee.org/">www.phoenix.tc-ieee.org</A>
  and set up a list server at <A HREF="#">tc-ieee-phoenix@majordomo.tc-ieee.org</A>
  to facilitate communications, Curt provided a proposed project
  on <A HREF="../007_Low_Power_Microprocessor/Low_Power_Microprocessor.htm">low
  power microprocessors</A>, and Wade presented <A HREF="../004_Piezo_Film_Blood_Flow_Sensor/Phoenix_PiezoPulse.htm">experimental
  data</A> from his prototype piezo film blood flow sensor.</P>
