  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>The <A HREF="http://www.msi.umn.edu/~halberg/">Halberg Chronobiology
  Center</A> seeks an ambulatory blood pressure monitor that, in
  concept, is usable by everyone on the planet, regardless of geography,
  access to capital, or clinical urgency. They want a 'supermarket'
  solution, not a 'premium market' solution. Their objective is
  to facilitate the collection of the information so that they
  can focus on diagnosis, prevention and treatment. They need a
  universal solution, not a niche solution. Furthermore, their
  objective is to enable the development of knowledge-based services,
  not just products, on which the medical community can base their
  decisions.</P>
  <P>The Open Source solution fits this problem. It focuses for-profit
  business activity on services and solutions rather than products.
  It can establish a universal 'product platform' to obtain and
  share information. It can create and substantially increase for-profit
  markets for those services and complementary product-service
  solutions.</P>
  <P>Over time, the Open Source model drives product cost towards
  zero. It is multinational because, in concept, it can be manufactured
  and used anywhere by anyone. By taking the high cost of intellectual
  property out of the process, it eliminates the need to increase
  product price to fund R&amp;D, to establish exclusive sourcing
  and marketing relationships to recover product costs, and to
  maximize profitability and return on investment that would otherwise
  restrict it to a smaller market segment.</P>
  <P>Lastly, the Open Source model facilitates collaborative volunteer
  communities and processes that are needed to develop, maintain
  and apply the monitor.</P>
