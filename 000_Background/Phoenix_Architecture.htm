  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>The subsystems of the Phoenix Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor
  (ABPM) are the Local Subsystem which is worn by the patient and
  the Remote Subsystem which is used by the healthcare practitioner
  and performs analysis and reporting.<BR>

  <P>The sensor reacts to blood flow to produce analog signals
  from which blood pressure and heart rate can be determined.</P>
  <P>The power component consists of batteries to provide electrical
  energy to other components and possibly a power generator such
  as piezo film or cable that restores energy to the battery.</P>
  <P>The processor converts the sensor signal to digital form,
  with date, time, heart rate, systolic pressure and diastolic
  pressure. Additional measures such as body movement and blood
  velocity would be helpful.</P>
  <P>The memory stores the blood measurements in digital form.
  It also may store program instructions, system information, and
  patient and situation information relevant to this usage of the
  monitor.</P>
  <P>The display may have the following forms: 1) an indicator
  that shows that the device is working normally or provides an
  error condition if it is not, 2) a readout display that shows
  the last blood pressure and heart rate measurement.</P>
  <P>Several communications interfaces are under consideration.
  These include a wired (contact) or wireless method to transfer
  the collected measurements to the remote subsystem. A removable
  flash memory card could also be used,<BR>
  such as one of the types found in digital cameras and other portable
  devices.</P>
  <H3>Remote Subsystem - used by the healthcare practitioner</H3>
  <P>It consists of a computer system that collects blood pressure
  measurements, analyzes them and assists in patient diagnosis
  and identifies treatment options.</P>
