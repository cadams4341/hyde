  <P>For those who question Phoenix's open source approach, we
  appreciate their caution and we understand the warning flags
  of &quot;where is the money&quot; and therefore the value.  This
  is a really important issue that deserves a serious, engaging
  and useful answer.  Perhaps a little humor can help, as well.
  </P>
  <P>The open source business approach requires the participant
  to be able to &quot;count to 2&quot; or trust someone who can.
   &quot;Counting to 2&quot; isn't about intelligence or business
  saavy or technical capability, but vision.  Intelligence, business
  saavy and technical capability are needed to configure and execute
  it successfully. </P>
  <P>First, you create the 'free product' and then you sell accessory
  product and service solutions.  The participants engaged in creating
  the free product are in the best position to create and successfully
  market the solutions. </P>
  <P>This approach has been used throughout human history, and
  probably since the 'big-bang', to create new markets so that
  new entrants can make a lot of money and avoid paying the ruinous
  entry fee in traditional markets defended by strong incumbents.
   </P>
  <P>Classic examples of this are:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Netscape - free browser, highly profitable servers &amp;
    services)
    <LI>Linux - free OS, highly profitable services &amp; accessory
    products)
    <LI>TCP/IP - free protocol, some free software, highly profitable
    complementary products &amp; services - e.g. VoIP)
    <LI>US Monetary System - invented by Alexander Hamilton, ...)
    <LI>Local, state &amp; federal highway systems - free highways,
    creates a commercial market for the surrounding land. 
    <LI>Software - first given away, then enhancements &amp; solutions
    were sold
  </UL>
  <P>Usually, the time for a &quot;counting to 2&quot; approach
  is triggered when markets are kept from changing by an oligarchy
  of strong incumbents and there are significant unmeet needs.
  </P>
  <P>New page: The 2-Step</P>
  <P>My sense is that the situation where &quot;counting to 2&quot;
  works best is where the value of intellectual property has declined
  because the traditional market (e.g. margins) has declined, and
  an oligarchy of incumbents and regulations are blocking new entrants,
  but there are significant unmet needs.  </P>
  <P>Recall the days before Netscape, when each computer manufacturer
  had their own network protocol (e.g. IBM's SNA), islands of corporate
  Ethernets needed to be connected, TCP/IP was the emerging protocol,
  PC based email was rampant, but there was no good way to find
  stuff if you didn't already know it was there.  Jim Clark &amp;
  the NCSA mosaic crew (Marc Andreesen et al) founded Netscape
  to create a ubiquitous client to navigate the internet.  The
  client was free, the server was priced, and the rest is history
  - they made A LOT of money.  Microsoft stole the golden goose,
  but by then the eggs were reproducing themselves and a lot faster
  than the goose did.  </P>
  <P>They aligned the money with who could and would pay for it
  - the seller/server, not the buyer/client (recall that the mainframe
  companies wanted the buyer to pay).  Same with Phoenix.  We (or
  someone) create value added services that organizations will
  love to pay for, using the Phoenix data. </P>
  <P>What is different is that Open Source is a consortium of companies
  (buyers &amp; sellers) and processes that enables the 2-step
  (1st step is free product, 2nd step is for-profit solutions),
  and reduces the effort/cost &amp; therefore increases profit.
   Netscape had to pioneer and create a huge infrastructure to
  do this.  Open Source makes it a lot simpler for the (smaller)
  individual product creator.  Just as complex international treaties
  led to standards organizations led to much simpler interoperability
  consortiums, Open Source is a simpler transitional form of the
  complicated and risky 2-step.  Simpler forms will follow.</P>
  <P>It seems that these changes are implemented by the smaller
  companies, in part because they don't have the financial resources
  to proceed in the traditional way and because the future trends
  involve cost reduction. Often, the earlier participants make
  A LOT of money because while prices decline, volumes increase
  far more.  Many of these trends are about packaging technology
  to the masses and really have marketing trends embedded within
  them, e.g. new ways for buyers and sellers to get together that
  take costs to both sides out of the equation.  </P>
