  <P>The Phoenix Project is a study group of the Twin Cities IEEE
  to design and develop an ambulatory blood pressure monitor for
  the Halberg Chronobiology Center at the University of Minnesota.
  Our goal is to make a monitor that is inexpensive, unobtrusive,
  easy to use and collects a week of blood pressure measurements.</P>
