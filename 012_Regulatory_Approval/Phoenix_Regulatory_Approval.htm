  <H3>Project Description</H3>
  <P>The purpose of the regulatory approval project is to identify
  requirements for regulatory approvals, and develop documents
  and processes to satisfy them. Geographic regions, such as the
  US and Europe, have specific requirements and approval processes
  that must be satisfied to use blood pressure monitors on people
  in their regions. We will develop a complete design sufficient
  for manufacturing, and our process and documentation combined
  with that of manufacturers must be sufficient to satisfy the
  regulatory approval requirements. We will validate this with
  a manufacturer by taking the monitor through an approval process
  so that the <A HREF="http://www.msi.umn.edu/~halberg/">Halberg
  Chronobiology Center</A> and other organizations can use the
  monitor in the <A HREF="../000_Background/Phoenix_Objectives.htm">Phoenix
  Measurement Program, in the Phoenix Clinical Program</A>, and
  by other organizations in their services and products.</P>
