  <P>The intent of the Phoenix Project is to create open hardware
  and software designs for an ambulatory blood pressure monitor
  (ABPM). That implies that all intellectual property located on
  this website is free from patent, copyright and trademark infringement.
  The patents listed below have been reviewed to determine if the
  technologies listed on this web site infringe on the patent rights
  of others. It is also used to determine if any newly issued patent
  attempts to protect technologies that have already been placed
  into the public domain by the volunteers of the Phoenix project.
  This is not a comprehensive list and should not be used as a
  substitute for legal counsel. The user assumes all responsibility
  for determining if their ambulatory blood pressure monitor design
  infringes on the intellectual property rights of others. Submissions
  to this list are encouraged, and should be sent to: <A HREF="mailto:e.nolley@ieee.org?subject=Phoenix_patents">e.nolley@ieee.org</A>.</P>

  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Motivation(s) for the Patent Review</FONT></B></P>
  <P>There are several reasons for reviewing these patents. The
  most important is to prevent patented technologies from entering
  the public Phoenix ABPM architecture. That's because the Phoenix
  ABPM is an <I>enabling technology</I> for an <I>open</I> <I>marketplace</I>.
  By definition, an open technology market can't be based around
  proprietary technologies. If it were, then the owner of the intellectual
  property could unfairly manipulate the market to their own advantage.
  Defending the public domain status of the Phoenix ABPM creates
  a technological <I>safe harbors</I> for those participating in
  the market.</P>
  <P>In theory, it shouldn't even be necessary to review these
  patents. That's because most patent offices won't issue a patent
  unless it is for a <I>novel </I>invention, meaning that it hasn't
  been thought of before. However, inventors and patent examiners
  may not necessarily be aware of the Phoenix ABPM technology because
  it's been placed into the public domain by publishing it on the
  internet (i.e. it's a <I>public works of invention</I>). This
  means that it doesn't appear in the patent file system. It also
  means that the only way to defend the Phoenix ABPM commons area
  is by monitoring new patents.</P>
  <P>The list of patent references also provides a good starting
  point for designers and other researchers who need to know if
  a specific blood pressure technology infringes on the rights
  of others. The patent documents are also a good place to learn
  how other people have solved similar problems. They are very
  good in this regard, as they must fully describe how to reproduce
  an invention.</P>
  <P>An excellent tutorial on the subject of patents can be found
  in <U>Patent It Yourself</U>, by David Pressman (ISBN: 1-4133-0025-1).
  While intended for inventors, it's also an excellent guide for
  anybody attempting to negotiate the US patent system.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Public Use</FONT></B></P>
  <P>The US Congress established several ways to place an invention
  into the public domain. Perhaps the easiest and least expensive
  way to do this is to destroy the novelty of the invention by
  publishing it for public use. Relevant regulations include <I>35
  U.S.C. 102(b): Conditions for Patentability; Novelty and Loss
  of Right to Patent</I>. In most cases this is sufficient to protect
  a patentable invention for public use.</P>
  <P>US patent law allows inventors to publicly disclose an invention
  and then apply for a patent at later date (up to one year from
  the initial public disclosure). This can create problems if somebody
  else sees it and attempts to patent the invention themselves
  during the one year grace period. If an inventor intends to to
  make the invention available for public use then good record
  keeping should be maintained. At a minimum these should include
  a detailed description of the invention (with sample claims,
  if possible), date of conception and date of initial public disclosure.
  If possible, these should be witnessed by someone else with at
  least ordinary skill in the art of the invention. The US Patent
  and Trademark Office (PTO) also allows an invention to be deposited
  with them under terms of the <A HREF="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/disdo.html">Disclosure
  Document Program (DDP)</A>, using form <A HREF="http://www.uspto.gov/web/forms/sb0095.pdf">PTO/SB/95</A>.</P>
  <P>The US Congress also provides for public inventions under
  <I>35 USC 157: Statutory Invention Registration</I> and <I>37
  CFR 1.293: Statutory Invention Registration</I>. The invention
  registration is similar to a patent, except that it doesn't have
  its enforceable offensive attributes. It's generally used as
  a defensive measure to prevent others from protecting the same
  invention. On-line resources can be found in the <A HREF="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/dapp/mpepmain.html">Manual
  of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP)</A>. That document contains
  the rules used by patent examiners at the US Patent Office. Relevant
  sections include: Section 1100 - Statutory Invention Registration
  and Pre-Grant Publications.</P>
  <P>In some cases Statutory Invention Registration may not be
  practical because: (a) they are too expensive to obtain (the
  application procedures are the same as patents) and (b) technology
  innovations come from many users around the globe. Instead, it's
  probably best to publicly disclose the invention and then monitor
  published patent applications and newly issued patents. If trouble
  arises a posse of interested parties can be formed to defend
  it. This same approach has worked very well in the past on various
  standardization technologies, and there is good evidence that
  it's working in the GNU/Linux world as well.</P>
  <P>The US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) has a <I>backlog
  delay</I> due to the high volume of applications that it handles.
  The <I>backlog delay</I> is the time interval between a patent's
  application date and its issue date. The backlog delay is important
  for public domain engineering projects because it can take several
  years before a patented invention can be found. For example,
  if a new feature is added to the Phoenix ABPM technology, then
  it can take some time to figure out if somebody else had already
  invented it. In 2004 the typical backlog delays at the US PTO
  were about 29.5 months. A search of <I>Published Patent Applications</I>
  at is also possible.</P>

  <B><FONT SIZE="+2">Intellectual Property, Industry Standards
  and RAND Policies</FONT></B></P>
  <P>One of the major goals of the Phoenix ABPM project is to create
  a set of royalty-free technologies. This is the same goal as
  many public standards organizations such as ANSI, IEEE, JEDEC
  and the OSI. All require that their standards be free of any
  overt intellectual property protection. This is accomplished
  by using RAND (Reasonable And Non Discriminatory) patent policies,
  which are summarized below.</P>
  <P>Most standards organizations operate so that their RAND policies
  only apply to the inter operability of devices, and not to any
  related technologies. For example, the USB 2.0 Standard (used
  on your desktop computer) covers inter operability of USB devices,
  but does not attempt to control things that are connected to
  the USB port (e.g. mice or cameras).</P>

  in <U>Guidelines for Implementation of the ANSI Patent Policy:
  An Aid to More Efficient and Effective Standards Development

  2003). It is available on-line by searching the ANSI web site
  at <A HREF="http://www.ansi.org/">www.ansi.org</A>. ANSI and
  its approved standards development organizations have adopted
  a policy known as <I>RAND</I>, or <I>Reasonable and Non Discriminatory</I>
  terms and conditions. That document states that a party identified
  by a standards development group as a patent holder must supply
  ANSI with either:</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>(1) a license will be made available without compensation
