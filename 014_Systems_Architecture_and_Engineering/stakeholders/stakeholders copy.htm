					<p>
					A stakeholder is somebody/thing that cares how a use case is executed -- that provides constraints and rules.
					Not all stakeholders interact with the system; that is, not all stakeholders are actors.
					Primary actors are listed in the Actor Profile Table.

			<h3>Actor Profile Table</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<blockquote><small>
					<p>
						A primary actor is a stakeholder that calls on the system to deliver one of its services.
						The primary actor is often, but not always, the actor that triggers a use case.
						(For example, the system design could call for a proxy to trigger a use case for a primary actor.)
					</p>
					<p>
						The name of an actor can mean an individual but more generally indicates the category of individuals who play a given role.
					</p>
