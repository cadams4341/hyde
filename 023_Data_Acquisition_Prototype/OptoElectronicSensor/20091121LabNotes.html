powered up Garrett's IR circuit and quite surprisingly were able to
obtain signals on fingers instantly without much tuning.&nbsp; We tried
to understand the delay between two channels placed on different
fingers.&nbsp; Chase suggested checking signals at different locations
such as ear, neck, cheeks, wrist, mid arm and fingers.&nbsp; Not much
luck in getting any signals except on fingers.&nbsp; Irrespective of
fingers (Index, middle, ring and pinky), we found some time delay (4ms
and 10 ms) between two fingers.&nbsp; We thought, signal on index
finger would lead signal on middle finger.&nbsp; Perhaps, signal on
different fingers vary with respect to different individuals (tried on
me, Steven and Chase).&nbsp; Found signals on mid arm and wrist with
varying time difference (76 ms and 16 ms).&nbsp; However, we noticed
that signal on wrist was leading mid arm.&nbsp; Time difference between
signals from channel 1 and 2 on same finger was close to zero.&nbsp; We
compared the time difference from wrist and mid arm with past work by
another Phoenix group.&nbsp; Found time difference on their work on
Pieozo film was approximately 40 ms.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><br>Steven
suggested to replace the 5 V DC power supply with a 5 V triangular wave
signal @ 1 Hz to study the time differences between two
channels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Found that signal on channel 2 led channel
1 by 4 ms.&nbsp; We suspect that this difference would be caused by the
circuit components. <br><br></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">Larry asked
Germaine and Othild (in the chronobiology department) if there was a
potential physiological reason for time differences in the signals
across fingers, and the answer was essentially "nothing that we know
of."<br></span><br><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Plans:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Look for any information reported on IR sensors used for blood pressure monitor and suggested time delay between signals.<br><br>Learn about other non-invasive blood pressure monitor techniques.<br><br></span><br><br><br><h3><a name="mozTocId667544"></a><font face="Times New Roman">About
