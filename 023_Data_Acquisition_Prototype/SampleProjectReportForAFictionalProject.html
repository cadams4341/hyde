  <h3>Introduction</h3>

This report describes a fictional project, and is intended to serve as
an example project report for Data Acquisition Device Prototype
projects.<br>

  <br>

In this report I describe a fictional device, the "Xineoph Ambulatory
Blood Pressure Monitor Prototype", and a fictional project to design
and build it.
  <h3>Project Overview</h3>

  <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>

The Xineoph Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor Prototype is a new kind
of ambulatory blood pressure monitor that is an unobtrusive ABPM that
records ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate readings for up to 7
days, then uploads those readings to a patient&#8217;s or
doctor&#8217;s computer for analysis.&nbsp; The device is
useful for
adults (age 13 and older) in preventive monitoring as well as
post-diagnosis monitoring.<br>

  <br>

With appropriate analysis software (the Sphygmochron), the Xineoph monitor supports a significant
new capacity to predict oncoming hypertension, stroke, heart disease,
kidney disease, eye damage.&nbsp; It gives doctors and their
patients
the ability to monitor the effectiveness of hypertension treatments and
discover autonomic neuropathy affecting heart rate and blood pressure
in diabetics without the currently very expensive test used for that
purpose.<br>

  <br>

This increase in capacity to monitor and prevent disease is a direct
result of the convenience and low cost (approximately $10) of the
Xineoph monitor.<br>

  <br>

This project built and tested a prototype device. &nbsp;The device
contains battery power, sensors, a microcontroller, non-volatile
memory,&nbsp;an interface for uploading the collected data, and
minimal
UI elements for controlling and testing the device.<br>

  <br>

The device is useful to the Phoenix Project to learn how to build
open-source medical devices. &nbsp;The Phoenix Project Coordination
Team serves as the "customer" for this project, and is the major
stakeholder. &nbsp; &nbsp;The Phoenix Project provides funding
for this
project, specifically arranging for funds to purchase hardware
components and software tools.<br>

  <h3>Product Description:</h3>

  <o:p>&nbsp;</o:p> <br>

The device
consists of a <o:p></o:p> <br>

  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="">�</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>dual
piezoelectric pressure sensor and
amplifier circuit, <o:p></o:p><br>

  <span style="">�</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>microcontroller, firmware in ROM, power-on
timer,&nbsp;dynamic memory, flash memory<o:p></o:p> <br>

  <span style="">�</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>radio frequency transmitter (Blacktooth), <o:p></o:p><br>

  <span style="">�</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>battery, and <o:p></o:p><br>

  <span style="">�</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>moisture-proof bandage. <o:p></o:p><br>

  </div>

The device is
disposable &#8211; it is not expected to be reused.<o:p></o:p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="">The
piezoelectric pressure sensors are mounted on a Monostyrofoam backing
strip 3
inches apart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Monostyrofoam strip is
� inch wide and 1/16 inch thick.<span style="">&nbsp;
  </span>The
exposed surface of the piezoelectric film is covered with a standard
Flubber
coating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other side of the
Monostyrofoam strip, at one inch from each end, are the microcontroller
with
built-in memory and Blacktooth radio transceiver modules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This sensor assembly is
adhered to a 4-by-1
inch bandage by the bandage&#8217;s adhesive, with the
Flubber-coated side of the
sensors exposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
applied to the
inner upper arm, the sensor array is aligned with and placed over the
brachial
artery, Flubber-coated side against the skin, and held in place by the
bandage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See Fig
11-1 for schematic
arrangement of the sensor assembly components.</p>

The design and packaging of the device, a single unit that is held on
the upper arm with a bandage, meets requirement R1 (ambulatorability)
well.
  <h4><span style="font-family: Arial;">Piezoelectric
sensor and amplifier<o:p></o:p></span></h4>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="">The
piezoelectric sensors are Measurement Specialties Inc. FLDT 028, coated
on one
side with a standard 1-molecule-thick Flubber coating.<span style="">&nbsp;
  </span>The Flubber coating transmits pulse
vibrations from the brachial artery to the sensor with no loss of
signal, of
course (because it is Flubber, after all).<span style="">&nbsp;
  </span>The piezo electric film generates an electric pulse of
up to 0.0000001
volt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This signal
is amplified by the
amplifier circuit that is adhered to the reverse side of the
piezoelectric film
and converted to a digital 0 volt or 3 volt signal.<span style="">&nbsp;
  </span>The amplifier circuit draws 0.22 microamps
from the battery.<o:p></o:p></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;The&nbsp;</o:p>
FLDT 028<o:p> sensors were selected in a previous project by
Akhila and it was a requirement (R3, R4) to use them in this prototype
device. &nbsp;Those requirements are met satisfactorily. &nbsp;</o:p></p>

  <h4><span style="font-family: Arial;">Microcontroller</span></h4>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="">The
microcontroller is a standard 8052Q microcontroller with 8K RAM, 8K
Flash ROM,
and 4K EEPROM built-in for memories.<span style="">&nbsp;
  </span>The
timer circuit (connected to the microcontroller&#8217;s first
interrupt pin) causes
the microcontroller, display, and sensor amplifier circuit to be
powered up for
up to one minute every 30 minutes.<span style="">&nbsp;
  </span>The
microcontroller firmware captures the timing of a pulse moving from the
first
sensor to the second sensor, and calculates the blood pressure from the
time it
takes for the pulse to move the 3 inches, using the method described in
Chen
et. al, US Patent No. 6,599,251, a soon-to-be-universal-standard
technique in non-invasive blood
pressure monitors to derive blood pressure from pulse delays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The microcontroller
firmware monitors the
first sensor until 5 pulses arrive; this is used to calculate the heart
rate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
timestamp, blood pressure, and heart rate
are burned into the Flash memory, and the microprocessor firmware
powers itself
down (until the timer powers it up again in 30 minutes, at which point
the
sequence repeats itself). &nbsp;The
microcontroller and built-in memory uses 0.55 microamps of power when
powered
up.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>The
microcontroller was
selected from the Microchip catalog based on power allocation (XX
milliamps), ability to read 3 sensors, and store the firmware in
built-in-ROM. &nbsp;It meets all these requirements adequately.
&nbsp;The 8502Q microcontroller has been around so long that it is
now
patent-free, and is available from multiple manufacturers, decreasing
the risk that it will become unavailable.</o:p></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>The
firmware to capture a reading and store it in flash memory is described
by the following pseudo-code:</o:p></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p><small style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">If State
is not &#8220;None&#8221;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // <span style="font-style: italic;">Upload
or reading is in progress, don&#8217;t interrupt it</span><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Return from interrupt<br>

Set State to &#8220;Recorder&#8221;<br>

If the Memory Address Register is 0<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // <span style="font-style: italic;">Hardware
error has occurred, e.g., lost power</span><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Execute Halt Mode<br>

If the Memory Address Register is at Max Address<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // <span style="font-style: italic;">Memory
is full, no room for more readings</span><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Execute Halt Mode<br>

Load reading from systolic sensor, store in next memory location<br>

Load reading from diastolic sensor, store in next memory location<br>

Load reading from heart rate sensor, store in next memory location<br>

Load reading from clock (for timestamp), store in next memory location<br>

Advance Memory Address Register<br>

Set State to &#8220;None&#8221;<br>

Execute Halt Mode<br>

  </small></o:p></p>

  <h4>Upload Button</h4>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="">A small "upload"
button
is connected to the microprocessor&#8217;s second interrupt pin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When that button is
pushed, the
microprocessor is powered up, and it executes a second firmware program
which
initializes the Blacktooth radio transceiver, transmits all stored
blood
pressure and heart rate data, and erases the Flash memory in
preparation for
capturing more readings.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="">The uploader
firmware is described by the following pseudo-code:</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><small style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">If State
is not &#8220;None&#8221;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // <span style="font-style: italic;">Upload
or reading is in progress, don&#8217;t interrupt it</span><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Return from interrupt<br>

Set State to &#8220;Uploader&#8221;<br>

If the Memory Address Register is 0<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Set Memory Address Register to Minimum Address<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Fill Memory with &#8220;Hardware
Error&#8221; indicator reading (-1,-1,-1,-1)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Advance Memory Address Register<br>

If the Memory Address Register is at Minimum Address<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // <span style="font-style: italic;">There
are no readings to upload</span><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Execute Halt Mode<br>

Calculate standard 16-bit checksum on data in Memory<br>

Set State to &#8220;None&#8221;<br>

Execute Halt Mode<br>

  </small><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>


  <h4>Event Button</h4>

The Event button is a simple push button connected to the
microcontroller's second interrupt pin. &nbsp;When pushed once, the
microcontroller flashes the light toggles between collecting data every
30 minutes and not collecting data every 30 minutes. &nbsp;When
pushed twice, the microcontroller stores the timestamp and an "event
happened" indicator into the flash memory.<br>

  <br>

This button meets requirements R5 and R7 adequately, but the project
noted that it was easy for two button pushes to be interpreted as two
single button pushes instead of a double push, and recommends a
different design for the final device.
  <h4><span style="font-family: Arial;">Radio
transceiver (Blacktooth)<o:p></o:p></span></h4>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span>The
Blacktooth
transceiver is Company XXX, model YYY (might get some idea of what to
use from
here: <a href="http://www.pdacortex.com/fda_approves_bluetooth_med_system.htm"><span class="WPHyperlink">http://www.pdacortex.com/fda_approves_bluetooth_med_system.htm</span></a>
).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It draws 0.22
microamps from the
battery when powered up and transmitting/receiving. <o:p></o:p></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><br>

  </p>

  <h4><st1:place w:st="on"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Battery</span></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></h4>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="">The battery is
a � inch diameter lithium medical-grade battery, 3 volts,
type DL2032 from
DurableCell, used in many home-quality non-invasive medical devices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is capable of supplying
1.00 microamp of
power for up to one minute every 30 minutes, more than enough power for
the
0.99 microamp load placed on it by the amplifier, microprocessor, and
radio
transceiver.<o:p></o:p></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

  <h4><span style="font-family: Arial;">Moisture-proof
bandage<o:p></o:p></span></h4>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span>The
bandage is
a standard water-proof 4x1 bandage from Yohnson and Yohnson, with the
absorbent
pad removed and replaced with the sensor array.<span style="">&nbsp;
  </span>This bandage is rated to stick to human skin for up to 7
days.<span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <h4><span style="font-family: Arial;">Patient-contacting
materials<o:p></o:p></span></h4>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="">The materials
that contact the patient&#8217;s skin while applying, wearing, and
removing the blood
pressure monitor are the Flubber coating on the piezoelectric sensors,
the
plastic bandage, and the adhesive on the bandage.<span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <h3>Project Testing Report</h3>

Jill installed the prototype device on Jack on Monday. &nbsp;Jack
pushed the button, and the light flashed "on" indicating it had started
taking data. &nbsp;On Tuesday at about 11:45, worried that his
blood pressure might be unnecessarily high, Jack pushed the button
twice to log the event that the cafeteria lady made him eat broccoli
again. &nbsp;On Friday, Jack pushed the button again, and the
light&nbsp;flashed "on" to indicate that it had stopped taking
data. &nbsp;He took the device off, confirmed no issues occurred
with operation or skin irritation and returned it to Jill.
&nbsp;Jill uploaded the data and verified that the device took the
correct number of readings by looking at the timestamps. &nbsp;Jill
declared success. &nbsp;Jack thought that one data point doesn't
make a trend.<br>
