  <h3>Project
Description</h3>This page
contains a list of "job openings" that volunteers can "fill" in the
Phoenix Project lab.&nbsp; This is really less formal than it sounds,
but is perhaps a useful way to describe the kinds of people we're
recruiting for at the moment.<br>
  <br>
People with skills not listed below or a desire to learn about blood
pressure monitor R&amp;D are encouraged to join the group also.&nbsp;
There's plenty of work to do in all areas, and at all skill levels.<br>
  <br>
 <h3>Project Deliverables</h3>The Phoenix Project Lab is comprised of
members that experienced in various roles, or that want to become
experienced in those roles.&nbsp; The desire to learn by volunteering
is often more important than being previously declared an expert.&nbsp;
Those that want to learn are often paired up with those that are
already experienced in our projects.<br>
  <br>
Phoenix Project Lab volunteers typically read academic literature,
design parts of products, build parts of products, or test parts of
products.&nbsp; Then they write up results of their work on a web
page.&nbsp; When possible, they attend lab meetings on a weekly,
monthly, or ad-hoc schedule, either via teleconferencing or on campus
at the University of Minnesota.<br>
  <br>
Phoenix Project Lab volunteers find that involvement in the Phoenix
Project brings benefits to their job searches and other professional
networking, find personal fulfillment as a member of a community
working on an important healthcare project, and just plain enjoy the
hobby.<br>
  <br>
Students that work on Phoenix Project Lab projects reinforce their
current educational activities, use the projects to meet class
requirements, and gain experience that makes their resume stand out
from the crowd.<br>
  <br>
The Phoenix Project Lab is currently asking for volunteers for the following roles: <br>
