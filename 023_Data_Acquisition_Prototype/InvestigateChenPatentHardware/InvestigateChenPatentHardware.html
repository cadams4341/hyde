  <h3>Project
Description</h3>

  <p>The purpose of the Investigate Chen Patent Issues subproject is
to answer questions about the suitability of using the concepts spelled out in the "Chen Patent" in our hardware.</p><p>Those questions include:</p><ul><li>What do we have to do to not violate the patent owner's rights?</li><li>Can we really believe the claims about constants "a" and "b" being related to each other, and other math, in the patent?</li><li>Can we demonstrate the ability to calibrate a pair of the piezoelectric sensors?</li><li>Can we demonstrate the ability to calculate blood pressure&nbsp;</li></ul>The
project would start with the piezoelectric sensors and amplifiers built
in previous projects and, using equipment in the UMN IEEE&nbsp;student
center lab, attempt to show that a device designed around the Chen
patent is actually viable.
