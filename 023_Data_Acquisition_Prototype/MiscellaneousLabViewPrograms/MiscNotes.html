  <h3>Project
Description</h3>This directory contains some LabView Virtual Instruments that have been used to collect data in the lab from early 2010 (from Jomar).<br><br>We are&nbsp; using the National Instruments USB-6009 Data Acquisition (DAQ) system.  <br>We were using SignalExpress V3.0.  
<br>We are currently using Labview V8 with NI-DAQmx9.0.2 Labview drivers for 
Win2007/XP.
