  <h3>Project
Description</h3>

  <p>The purpose of the Timers On COTS Monitors subproject is
to
gain experience building small circuits, push the price of the <a href="../../018_Sphymochron_Spreadsheet/SphygmochronOrgWebsite/200DollarHomeABPM.html">$200 Home ABPM kit</a>
down to less than $100, provide the hardware for some science research
on the quality of COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) monitors used in an
ambulatory way (they are not designed for that), and build up to the
ability to design the complete data acquisition prototype circuit and
board.</p><h3>Project Deliverables</h3>Papers and Presentations<br><a href="http://www.phoenix.tc-ieee.org/0001_Bibliography/20081221beat_FirstHomemadeABPM.pdf">Towards inexpensive ambulatory blood pressure variability monitors for home use (March 2009).</a><br><a href="Towards%20inexpensive%20home%20Ambulatory%20BP%20Monitors.pdf">Presentation on first attempts to use wrist monitors (27 July 2009).</a><h3>Lab Notes</h3><a href="LabNotes20090307.html">20090307</a><h3>Project Report</h3><h3>Volunteers Are Needed</h3>
