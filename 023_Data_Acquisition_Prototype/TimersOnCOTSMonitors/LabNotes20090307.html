  </h2><br>Erik and I started characterizing the
(presumably piezoelectric) buzzer in the Omron Wrist Monitor.  We put
an oscilloscope on the buzzer.

<br><br>In image0001, we see that pulses come in pairs, about 1.15 seconds
apart.  The total voltage varies from 0 volts to 4 volts.  (One size
of the buzzer is connected directly to the battery ground.  We don't
know what the other size is connected to.)  During the first pulse of
a pair, the voltage varies from 0 to 4 volts, but during the second
pulse, the voltage varies from 1 volt to 4 volts.

<br><br><img style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" alt="20090307Image0001.jpg" src="Images/20090307Image0001.jpg"><br><br>In image0002, we have a closer look at a pair of the pulses, and see
that they're 30 millisecond long overall, with a 30 millisecond pause
between them.  (The bottoms and tops of the pulses are pretty rough -
this is an artifact of the sampling rate or pixelated display of the
oscilloscope.)

<br><br><img style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" alt="20090307Image0002.jpg" src="Images/20090307Image0002.jpg"><br><br>In image0003 we zoomed in on the start of the first pulse of a pair. 
The voltage is 0 volts to 4 volts, the peak lasts for 250
microseconds, and the separation between pulses is also 250
microseconds.

<br><br><img style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" alt="20090307Image0003.jpg" src="Images/20090307Image0003.jpg"><br><br>In image0004 we zoomed in on the start of the second pulse of a pair. 
Each individual pulse here is 125 microseconds long, with 125
microsecond separation between them.  The voltage range of 1 to 4
volts is now explained: with only 125 microseconds available, the
voltage simply doesn't have time to drop all the way to zero.  (In
other words, the drop is following the same curve in the first and
second pulses of the pair.)  The first tiny pulse is consistently
different than the others, but in a way that I presume is irrelevant.
