  <h3>Status Report</h3></blockquote><blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">Notes from the Phoenix IEEE lab, 2008/11/08<br><br>Our categories of work:<br>&nbsp; - Improving the sensors and amplifier/filter boards<br>&nbsp; - Investigating the Chen patent<br>&nbsp; - Building a prototype microcontroller/DAQ board<br>&nbsp; - Reducing the cost of the $200 Home ABPM kit to $100<br>&nbsp; - Investigating optoelectronic sensors<br><br>This week's activities:<br><br>The email list is set up and working.&nbsp; Everyone should feel encouraged to post all discussions to the email list.<br><br>Steven James has returned to the project in the form of a part-time consultant.<br><br>I "demonstrated" the $200 Home ABPM "kit" from a couple of years ago.<br><br>I
brought in a laptop that was donated to us, and started installing
LabView on it. &nbsp;(This laptop will stay in the lab for any team
member to use at any time for LabView DAQ work.)<br><br>We discussed shortcomings (e.g., 1Hz phase distortion) of the filter part of Wade's original amplifier/filter board.<br><br>Chase
and I tried to follow William's instructions to get U of MN library
cards, and were stopped at the border.&nbsp; Information from the
reference desks seems to indicate that our best route would be to
become unpaid staff of the Chronobiology or Electrical Engineering
departments.<br><br>Active tasks:<br><br>Chase is summarizing some of
the commercial product technology he's been reading about, considering
buying another NI DAQ device, and looking into whether we should get a
second piezoelectric film kit.<br><br><br>Dr. Holte is looking into how we can get access to the campus wireless network or the EE/CS wireless network.<br><br>Dr. Holte is going to send Steven and Larry some web links related to encouraging students to enter Engineering fields.<br><br>I am talking to the coordination team about doing some recruiting to get a few more people involved.<br><br>I am contacting Wade Peterson and Mike Callaghan to recover lost project information from the past.<br><br>Mary Jo is making a copy of the damaged LabView device driver disks.<br><br>Steven is designing a a 555-based timer circuit for the $100 Home ABPM kit. &nbsp;Hopefully William will build it for us.<br><br>Steven is making some project managment notes.<br><br>Steven is looking at Wade's schematic in the hopes of being able to describe the details or design changes to it.<br><br>Vince
is investigating where we can get some optoelectronic sensors to start
playing with, and will give me a shopping list.&nbsp; Checking out
Nonin (Phil Isakson), Hutchinson Technologies, etc.<br><br>Vince is going to ask the student branch (Hans) for a computer account in the lab and a door pass.<br><br>William is talking to Dr. Holte about designing a change to Wade's circuit to use an instrumentaton amplifier.<br><br><br>Future tasks:<br><br>We need to come up with some more test leads and connectors, and a battery tester.<br><br>I'd
like to get 2 or 3 more of Wade's amplifier/filter boards made.&nbsp;
Dr. Holte thinks we can make some improvements to them at the same
time.&nbsp; William is going to talk to Dr. Holte about Dr. Holte's
ideas for improvements,&nbsp; specifically adding and removing a
voltage bias on the sensors and changing the amplifier characteristics
(possibly by switching to an "instrumentation amplifier" design).&nbsp;
In addition, we now have to consider changes to the filter.<br><br>I'd
like to have a detailed description of Wade's schematic, including
details about each subcircuit, the test points, the power supply, and
the input impedence.<br><br>We need a little project to identify and
mark the various piezo-electric films.&nbsp; It seems likely that that
we cannot trust any of the packaging any more, because of the number of
hands that have moved things around.<br><br>We need projects to
characterize AND DOCUMENT simple characteristics of the piezoelectric
films - specifically to understand whether thick backing vs. thin
backing is better, whether large surface areas vs. small surface areas
are better, etc.<br><br>We need to consider getting a BP device OTHER
THAN A CUFF to take continuous BP measurements while we're testing our
sensors and devices, for calibration and comparison purposes.&nbsp;
This is likely to be a high-dollar purchase, or donation from a
philanthropic organization.<br><br>-Larry<br><h3>Volunteers Are Needed</h3>
