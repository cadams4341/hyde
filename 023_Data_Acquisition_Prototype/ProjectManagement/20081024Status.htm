  <h3>Status Report</h3></blockquote><blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">Notes from the Phoenix IEEE lab, 2008/10/24<br><br><br>Our categories of work still fall into:<br>&nbsp; - Improving the sensors and amplifier/filter boards<br>&nbsp; - Investigating the Chen patent<br>&nbsp; - Building a prototype microcontroller/DAQ board<br><br>William
and I spent a little time getting a signal out of Wade's amplifier by
following a tighter protocol about wrapping up the arm with the sensor
and controlling breathing and movement.&nbsp; We didn't have time to
get a completely clean signal, but it was clear that this was a much
easier way to get a signal than the previous informal "playing around"
that we've done.&nbsp; It supports the statement that I made earlier,
which is that all the projects that have been done so far (Wade, Mary
Jo, Inanc/Ashok, Akhila) and the commercial products we've looked at
all put a lot of effort into the mechanics of the sensor to get a
usable signal.<br><br>The student branch created computer accounts for
me and William.&nbsp; We have not gotten "permanent" disk space yet,
however.&nbsp; (We need something that is not wiped clean at the end of
the semester.)<br><br>Chase is summarizing some of the commercial
product technology he's been reading about, considering buying another
NI DAQ device, and looking into whether we should get a second
piezoelectric film kit.<br><br>I'd like to get 2 or 3 more of Wade's
amplifier/filter boards made.&nbsp; Dr. Holte thinks we can make some
improvements to them at the same time.&nbsp; William is going to talk
to Dr. Holte about Dr. Holte's ideas for improvements, specifically
adding and removing a voltage bias on the sensors and changing the
amplifier characteristics (possibly by switching to an "instrumentation
amplifier" design).<br><br>We need to come up with some more test leads and connectors, and a battery tester.<br><br>I'll talk to the coordination team about doing some recruiting to get a few more people involved.<br><br>I
brought in a "junk box" of materials that might make good sensor
backing, a stethoscope, and a wrist-mount blood pressure monitor.<br><br>I brought in a surface-mount soldering "practice kit" for me and William to use.<br><br>William
is looking into the procedure for non-students to get access to Walter
Library, including online access to journals and ability to physically
check out books.<br><br>Dr. Holte is looking into how we can get access to the campus wireless network.<br><br>Ellis has requested a mailing list for us to use.<br><br>For the future:<br><br>We
need a little project to identify and mark the various piezo-electric
films.&nbsp; It seems likely that that we cannot trust any of the
packaging any more, because of the number of hands that have moved
things around.<br><br>I'd like to have a detailed description of Wade's
schematic, including details about each subcircuit, the test points,
the power supply, and the input impedence.<br><br>We need projects to
characterize AND DOCUMENT simple characteristics of the piezoelectric
films - specifically to understand whether thick backing vs. thin
backing is better, whether large surface areas vs. small surface areas
are better, etc.<br><br>-Larry<br><h3>Volunteers Are Needed</h3>
