  <h3>Status Report</h3></blockquote><blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">Notes from the Phoenix IEEE lab, 2009/03/08<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Our categories of work</span>:<br>&nbsp; - Improving the sensors and amplifier/filter boards<br>&nbsp; - Investigating the Chen patent<br>&nbsp; - Building a prototype microcontroller/DAQ board<br>&nbsp; - Reducing the cost of the $200 Home ABPM kit to $100<br>&nbsp; - Investigating optoelectronic sensors<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recent activities</span>:<br><br>Between
Christmas break (mid-December to late January) and the water pipes
breaking in the building (most of February), we have had almost no time
in the lab for the past two and a half months. &nbsp;We've been using
temporary space such as the lounge in the EE building and a classroom
in the Mayo building that Dr. Halber and Dr. Cornelissen were able to
arrange for us. &nbsp;The access to the lab seems to have stabilized
now, and we've moved all our equipment back into the locker.<br><br>Erik
programmed the TI MSP430 microcontroller to act as a timer for the
Omron wrist monitor. &nbsp;This is the first version of the code, and
uses simple busy-wait loops for timing. &nbsp;It's currently triggering
the monitor every 38 minutes or so, and the first set of full batteries
lasted a little over 3 days, as predicted. &nbsp;I've been wearing the
monitor for about 5 days now, collecting the data. &nbsp;Germaine did
an initial analysis on the first couple of days of data, which raises
more questions than answers at that early stage.<br><br>Steven and
William are designing a surface-mount miniaturized version of the
analog timer, and I'm ordering parts and tools so they can build one.<br><br>Jason has installed dual-boot "Puppy Linux" and MPLAB on his laptop, for programming PIC microprocessors.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Active tasks</span>:<br><br>Erik is looking into how to use the timers built into the TI microcontroller for better accuracy and reduced power consumption.<br><br>Chase is summarizing some of
the commercial product technology he's been reading about, considering
buying another NI DAQ device, and looking into whether we should get a
second piezoelectric film kit.<br><br>I
am working with Germaine to design more statistical tests to determine
if the wrist monitor can really produce useful Sphygmochrons.<br><br>Steven
and I are looking at details of how to add a buzzer to the digital
timers, to provide a warning a few seconds ahead of a reading being
taken (the wearer needs to stop moving and prevent the monitor from
being bumped while the reading is in progress, and the current monitor
doesn't give such a warning because it wasn't designed to be triggered
while the wearer is not expecting it).<br><br>Dr. Holte is looking into how we can get access to the campus wireless network or the EE/CS wireless network.<br><br>I will talk to the coordination team about doing some recruiting to get a few more people involved.<br><br>I will be contacting Wade Peterson to recover lost project information from the past.<br><br>Steven is making some project managment notes.<br><br>Steven is looking at Wade's schematic in the hopes of being able to describe the details or design changes to it.<br><br>Vince
is investigating where we can get some optoelectronic sensors to start
playing with, and will give me a shopping list.&nbsp; Checking out
Nonin (Phil Isakson), Hutchinson Technologies, etc.<br><br>Vince is going to ask the student branch (Hans) for a computer account in the lab and a door pass.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Future tasks</span>:<br><br>We need to come up with some more test leads and connectors, and a battery tester.<br><br>I'd
like to have a detailed description of Wade's schematic, including
details about each subcircuit, the test points, the power supply, and
the input impedence.<br><br>We need a little project to identify and
mark the various piezo-electric films.&nbsp; It seems likely that that
we cannot trust any of the packaging any more, because of the number of
hands that have moved things around.<br><br>We need projects to
characterize AND DOCUMENT simple characteristics of the piezoelectric
films - specifically to understand whether thick backing vs. thin
backing is better, whether large surface areas vs. small surface areas
are better, etc.<br><br>We need to consider getting a BP device OTHER
THAN A CUFF to take continuous BP measurements while we're testing our
sensors and devices, for calibration and comparison purposes.&nbsp;
This is likely to be a high-dollar purchase, or donation from a
philanthropic organization.<br><br>-Larry<br><h3>Volunteers Are Needed</h3>
