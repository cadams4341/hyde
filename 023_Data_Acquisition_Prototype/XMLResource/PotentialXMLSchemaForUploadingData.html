  <h3>Project
Description</h3>




  
  
  
  <p>The purpose of the Potential XML Schema for Uploading Data subproject is
to define a small XML schema that defines the format of data uploaded from the prototype device to a computer.</p>



  
  
  
  <p>There are standards for this kind of data that could be used; this
schema serves for an interim period until standards are investigated
and any decision about which, if any, are to be used.</p>




  
  
  
  <h3>Project Deliverables</h3>

  
  <h4>XML References</h4>

A rather comprehensive repository of XML references is the "Cover Pages":<br>

  <a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/AboutXMLCoverPages.html">http://xml.coverpages.org/AboutXMLCoverPages.html</a><br>

  <br>

An interesting discussion of the problem with DTDs can be found at:<br>

  <a href="http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/bible3/chapters/ch20.html">http://www.cafeconleche.org/books/bible3/chapters/ch20.html</a><br>

This material discusses how xsd schemas solved those problems, as well as<br>

touching briefly on other schema approaches such as RELAX-NG and<br>

Schematron.<br>
  <br>
  <h4>Example XML Stream</h4>
Here is an example of what the XML data that uploads from the device should look like.<br>


  
  <a href="./Prototype-004.xml">Example XML stream</a><br>
  <h4><br>
  </h4>
  <h4>Example XMLSchema</h4>
Here is an example XMLSchema definition for the XML data stream.
&nbsp;While it is unlikely that the device would use XMLSchema directly
to generate the XML data stream, application and test programs might
make use of this schema in code generators. &nbsp;Therefore, it's
important for the generated XML data to agree with this (or some other
selected) definition. &nbsp;<a href="Prototype-004.xsd">Example XMLSchema</a>
