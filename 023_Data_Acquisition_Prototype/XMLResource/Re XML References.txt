Sorry to hear about problems on the sister-in-law front.  I sent along
something before just to get the ball rolling, not that I thought what I
had was anywhere close to what we wanted.  Glad to hear you had a roughly
similar point of view.

I put in a quality number: 1-10, with 10 being very high quality.

I presently have the XML set up to contain a value only if one was obtained.

I have to admit that I am well short of crystal clear on how to dummy up a
set of raw values that would legitimately correspond to computed values. 
I propose we leave that to later.

Attached is a new, perhaps improved, XML file with an associated xsd schema.
