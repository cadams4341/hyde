  <h3>Project
Description</h3>

  <p>The
purpose of the Improve Piezoelectric Sensors subproject is
to answer questions about the suitability of using the piezoelectric
sensors and amplifier circuits built in previous projects, then improve
them, providing a valuable input to the <a href="../Data_Acquisition_Prototype.htm">Data Acquisition Device Prototype</a> project.</p><p>Those questions include:</p><ul><li>Can we get the accuracy needed to meet the ANSI SP10 standard for blood pressure monitors?</li><li>How close together&nbsp;can the sensors be?</li><li>Can we use the inside of the upper arm so it's close to the heart? &nbsp;Is that even necessary?</li><li>Can we get to where the wearer doesn't have to stop breathing? &nbsp;(See Akhila's paper)</li><li>What materials and mechanism do we need to provide better skin-to-sensor contact to improve the signal-to-noise ratio?</li><li>What changes do we need to the amplifier circuit to prevent clipping of the signal in the presence of high blood pressures?</li></ul>The project would start with the piezoelectric sensors and amplifiers
built in previous projects and, using equipment in the UMN IEEE&nbsp;student
center lab, attempt to answer the questions above.
