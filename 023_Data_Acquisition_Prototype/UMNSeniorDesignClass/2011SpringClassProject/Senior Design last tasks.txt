<br>Item 1:  The final reports for senior design are now due.  You should have received a digital copy by e-mail from your team.  Please email your team if they have not sent a copy to you.<br><br>Please grade your team&#39;s report (on a 0 to 30 pt. scale, as indicated below) and e-mail me your score no later than 8:00 pm, Saturday, May 14.<br>
<br>30 pts. – A<br>26 pts. – A-/B+<br>22 pts. – B<br>18 pts. – B-/C+<br>14 pts. – C<br>10 pts. – C-/D+<br>6 pts. – D<br>0 pt. – F<br><br>Note that the final report is a team effort (15% of their course grade) and should be evaluated as such, so team members were not required to identify individual contributions to the report.  You should plan to focus on both technical content and writing style in your grading.  In addition to your grade, the course TA and I will also be grading the reports.  Also note that I left the format open so part of their task was to determine reasonable criteria to select what should be in the report and to use an appropriate structure to deliver that content.  They were told that the report was being produced for the benefit of their client, as a reference for their team, and as a permanent record of the project. <br>
<br><br>Item 2:  By 8:00 pm, Saturday, May 14, please also send me a recommended course letter grade (A, A-, B+, B, etc.) for each of your team members, along with brief written comments about each student with respect to their performance this semester.<br>
<br>This information will be used as an individual performance assessment (20% of their course grade) for each of your team member and in determining their final course grade. This is an opportunity for you to provide an evaluation of each individual team member’s performance separate from the other graded elements of the course and for you to distinguish between the levels of performance of the team members.<br>
<br>By way of context, the average class GPA for EE 4951 is typically around 3.5/4.0.  (This is the historical range of grades, although this may need to be revisited in light of grade inflation).  </span><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; ">This consists of roughly:<br>
A and A- combined for 40-50% of the class<br>B+ and B combined for 40-50% of the class<br>B-, C+, and C combined for 10% of the class.<br><br><br>Please let me know if you have any questions.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Paul<br>
